          "Zack Tabudlo an alt-pop and r&b artist from Manila, Philippines. He is also music producer, songwriter, and a mult-instrumentalist. \n\nSince being a finalist in The Voice Kids in 2014, Zack has released self-written compositions, and has worked on notable local and international collaborations. He produced and arranged actor Carlo Aquino's rendition of 'Balisong (Transformed)' and Sharlene San Pedro's singles 'Everything Will Be Alright' and 'Pusong Naliligaw' (2019). \n\nIn 2020, Zack became part of the maiden roster of Island Records Philippines, and has since released singles \u201cNangangamba\u201d, \u201cCruel\u201d, \u201cSigurado\u201d, \u201cIyong Iyo\", and \"Elizabeth\". This March 2021, he released his catchiest tune yet entitled \"Binibini\". \n\nGoing beyond traditional pop music he was known for in the past, Zack infuses music with lyrics to reflect his growth both as a musician and as a teenager. His talent of mixing a balance of new and old techniques in music production as well as his singing prowess makes his tracks versatile and imaginative. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Zack+Tabudlo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Official site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n\n    In 2009, Carminho sang \"Fado\". This was her fado, the one she owned since an early age, when she listened to her parents\u2019 records, when she witnessed the gathering of fado singers in her own house and when, still a teenager, she began to sing in the Taverna do Embu\u00e7ado. This \"Fado\" was the title of her first album, which was one of the most awaited albums in the new generation of fado singers: for those who had already heard Carminho, her talent was obvious, but they had to wait \u2013 until she finished her graduation, until she travelled the world, until she knew who she really was.\n\n    And her \"Fado\" became one of the most acclaimed albums in 2009.  It went Platinum \u2013 an enviable outcome for a debut album. With \"Fado\", Portugal surrendered to Carminho\u2019s voice and the doors of the world opened to her talent.  It was considered best album 2011 by Songlines magazine, she had shows in European capital cities, in Womex 2011 (Copenhagen) and in the UNESCO headquarters, in Paris, within the scope of Fado as World Heritage candidate. Then came the invitation to participate in Pablo Albor\u00e1n\u2019s album, which became a phenomenon of popularity in both Portugal and Spain.\n    It was about time that \u201cFado\u201d had a worthy successor. And it's just around the corner. On 5th March, Carminho reveals her \"Alma\" (Portuguese word for soul) with 15 new songs, an album again produced and directed by Diogo Clemente, again wisely combining cover versions and originals (in the special edition, the album has 17 songs and a DVD with Carminho live in concertin May 2011 at Lux Fr\u00e1gil, Lisbon.\n\n    The cover versions are less evident. Some not so well known songs by Am\u00e1lia (\"Cabe\u00e7a de Vento\"), Maria Am\u00e9lia Proen\u00e7a (\"\u00c0 Beira do Cais\") or Fernanda Maria (\"As Pedras da Minha Rua\"), but also from Chico Buarque (\"Meu Namorado\", de \"O Grande Circo M\u00edstico\") or Vinicius de Moraes (\"Saudades do Brasil em Portugal\"). The original songs are by Diogo Clemente (\"Bom Dia, Amor\", about poet Fernando Pessoa), M\u00e1rio Pacheco (\"Talvez\", lyrics by Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura), and Vitorino (\"Fado Adeus\"). And there are also some new lyrics for traditional fado tunes \u2013 one of them, \"Folha\", written by Carminho herself, and another one, \"Impress\u00e3o Digital\", a poem by Ant\u00f3nio Gede\u00e3o.\n\nAnd it is this mixture of past and present that allows us to unveil the future of Fado, in the unrivalled voice of Carminho. A voice which, in her second album, sustains all that Carminho sings in \"Talvez\": \"I might not know who you are, but I know who I am\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, she released a Tom Jobim covers album, titled \"Carminho Canta Tom Jobim\". \n\nOfficial site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carminho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "\u00d3scar Alfonso Castro (born December 20, 1986 in Obreg\u00f3n, Sonora), better known as Caloncho, is a Mexican musician and singer.\n\nAs a child, Caloncho lived in Guadalajara where his favorite activity was playing the drums, until he later decided to experiment with melody. At the same time, he started playing the guitar that his grandfather had left for him years before, and soon learned to play songs from artists such as Bob Marley and Sublime.\n\nBased on his own confession, Caloncho was the name his grandfather and step-sister, Ang\u00e9lica, used to call him when he was very little and since the name never annoyed him, he decided to use it as his musical stage name.\n\nHis first EP \"Homeotermo\" was recorded in 2011, and soon after, he started working with m\u00fasician Siddhartha (a former-teacher and friend). He asked him to be his producer and Siddhartha agreed, saying about him: \"Caloncho is a newly born musician, he is being newly discovered, both by himself and by those around him. He sent me a sample of his music and I immediately felt it was a musical obligation to help extract the sweet juice from his fruitful melodies.\" (Caloncho's website).\n\nCaloncho then released his second EP, titled \"Fruta\" (Fruit), in September 2013. This production mixes his unique musical style with rhythms and stories of Mexican national folk, beaches, and forest rhythms, as well as urban sounds. All these sounds are used to retell different situations from his own life.\n\n\"We experimented a lot during the creation of the EP. We used organic sounds and objects that are not considered musical instruments, such as water, fruit, seeds, lighters, etc. I love it and I want to hear it\", he said.\n\nCalancho has admitted that thanks to music, he has been able to live his life through all his senses. Music has also allowed him to feel completely connected with his family. \"My dad would write and play songs for us, and he would invite us to build on them, as a way to be in communion with each other,\" he's said.\n\nIn 2015 he published the LP, \"Fruta Vol. II\" (Fruit Vol. II), a production worked with certain arrangements.\n\nHe was nominated for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.\n\n\n\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Caloncho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Karly-Marina Loaiza, professionally known as Kali Uchis, is a Colombian-American singer-songwriter, record producer, music video director and fashion designer. She writes and produces most of her own music.\n\nThe stylistic range of left-field pop artist Kali Uchis is reflected in the variety of her collaborators \u2013 an extensive genre-crossing list that includes Tyler, the Creator, Gorillaz, Daniel Caesar, Juanes, and BadBadNotGood. A singer, songwriter, and producer, as well as a video director, Uchis truly arrived on her own with the self-released Por Vida (2015), an EP that led to a deal with Virgin EMI. By the time Uchis released her lively debut full-length, the Top Five Billboard R&B/hip-hop hit Isolation (2018), she had already been nominated for Grammy awards through her featured appearances on Daniel Caesar's \"Get You\" and Juanes' \"El Ratico.\"\n\nKali Uchis experienced the majority of her upbringing in Virginia and also spent time in her parents' native Colombia. As a teenager growing up in Alexandria, just south of Washington, D.C., she learned to play piano and saxophone and also developed a deep interest in visual arts. Her recorded debut was made in 2012 with the self-released mixtape Drunken Babble. Within three years, she had several singles to her credit, including \"Know What I Want\" and \"Lottery,\" typically promoted with videos she directed, as well as collaborations with Snoop Dogg, GoldLink, Tyler, the Creator, and Major Lazer. Following the 2015 independent release of Por Vida, a free digital-download EP with tracks produced by Diplo, Kaytranada, and Tyler, Uchis started releasing her material through major-label Virgin EMI. A DJ Dahi-tweaked version of Por Vida's \"Ridin Round,\" issued that November after a move to Los Angeles, was the artist's first single for the major label. \"Only Girl,\" a relaxed Kaytranada production featuring Vince Staples and the Internet's Steve Lacy, followed in April 2016. She was also featured that year on Daniel Caesar's \"Get You.\"\n\nThroughout 2017, Uchis added to her discography of featured appearances via tracks by Juanes, Gorillaz, Tyler, Bootsy Collins, and Miguel, and she previewed her debut album with the singles \"Tyrant\" (featuring Jorja Smith) and \"Nuestro Planeta\" (featuring Reykon). By the end of the year, \"Get You\" had been nominated for a Grammy in the category of Best R&B Performance, and Juanes' \"El Ratico\" made Uchis a Latin Grammy nominee when it was up for Record of the Year. January 2018 saw the release of the BadBadNotGood-produced single \"After the Storm\" (featuring Tyler and Bootsy). Uchis released her debut album, Isolation, three months later. It debuted at number 32 on the Billboard 200 and entered the R&B/hip-hop chart at number four.\n\nhttp://kaliuchis.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kali+Uchis\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Holocausto Canibal is a band from Porto that was manifested during the Autumn of 1997, assembled by erstwhile members of acts such as Nephrit, Web, Dying Season, Wintershades and Impious in vocalist Ricardo Silva, guitarist Nuno, bassist Z\u00e9 Pedro and drummer Jo\u00e3o Lamela. The first line up change occurred in October 1998 when Silva was asked to leave. New man Carlos would be drafted for recording of the rehearsal demo 'oPus I'. The sale of over 1000 cassettes prompted a debut album, 'Gonorreia Visceral' being laid down at Rec n' Roll Studios in September 1999, being released by So Die Music in February 2000. Jo\u00e3o Lamela quit shortly afterward and Holocausto Canibal persevered with a drum machine for the national 'Chaos And Disorder' tour packaged with ThanatoSchizo and The Firstborn.\n\nThe group would re-introduce Ricardo Silva as lead vocalist and enrolled Ivan on the drums and in November 2000 undertook a further headline tour, dubbed 'Portuguese Bastards', with support from Goldenpyre and Corpus Christii. Next product would be the video 'Gore, Vulva e Holocaustos' comprising live footage, interviews and suitably gory moments from cult movies. The album 'Sublime Massacre Corporeo' emerged in 2002.\n\nHolocausto Canibal shared a 2003 split album with Italian Grind act Grimness. The album cover was horrific even by Grindcore standards. The band also put in an appearance at the 2003 'Steel Warriors Rebellion VI' festival alongside Enthroned, Internal Suffering, Katatonia, Finntroll, Attick Demons, Neoplasmah, Pitch Black, Corpus Christii, In Thy Flesh, Axe Murderers, Agonized, ThanatoSchizo, Flagellum Dei and Eternal Mourning. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Holocausto+Canibal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "\"Ella Baila Sola\" is a song by the American regional Mexican group Eslabon Armado, and Mexican singer Peso Pluma. It was released on March 17, 2023, through DEL Records and Prajin Parlay, as the lead single for the group's album Desvelado (2023). The song was written and produced by Pedro Tovar, and production was also handled by Maurillo Pineda Jr. and Ernesto Fernandez.\n\nOriginally teased on TikTok, the song would go viral on the platform and would eventually lead up to it becoming the first regional Mexican song in history to reach the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number four, as well as the first to top the Billboard Global 200. It would reach over 1 billion streams on Spotify by December 2023, making it the first regional Mexican song to reach the milestone. The song would also be certified 21\u00d7 Platinum in the Latin field by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) with over 1 million copies sold, with other certifications in Spain, Italy, and Portugal.\n\nTo date, it is the group and the singer's most commercially successful single, with over 1 billion streams on Spotify; the milestone was reached at the end of 2023, also charting worldwide. Peso Pluma would release a remix version of \"La Beb\u00e9\" with Yng Lvcas, simultaneously with \"Ella Baila Sola\", where it also performed successfully, peaking at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 along with the latter's peak. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Eslabon+Armado/_/Ella+Baila+Sola\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "California-based trio Eslabon Armado's name translates as \"linked chain.\" Illustrated by their interlocking three-part vocal harmonies, woven acoustic guitars, and basses, the group's music re-frames the Regional Mexican music of ranchera with the language of \"sierre\u00f1a music,\" the \"music of the mountain ranges.\" While the rhythms and melodies are similar to those found in norte\u00f1o, the (mostly) guitars-and-vocals-only approach creates a similar feeling to that of campfire music played by wandering campesino minstrels. The group's first two singles, \"Con Tus Besos\" and \"La Trokita,\" both came out of nowhere to place on the upper rungs of the Regional Mexican, Latin Songs, and Latin streaming lists. Their 2020 debut album, Tu Veneno Mortal, reached number one on the Mexican Regional Albums chart -- the first of three chart-topping long-players the group issued in ten months.\n\nEslabon Armado was founded in 2017 by Two brother and One teen friends: lead vocalist and requinto guitarist Pedro Tovar (also the band's songwriter), guitarist/harmony vocalist Gabriel Hidalgo, and acoustic bassist/bajoloche player Brian Tovar, who also sings harmony. As individuals, the trio's members were deeply influenced by the music of their parents' generation. Before branching out to write original material, they'd studied and played rancheras and norte\u00f1o music since they were small children. As teens, however, they absorbed the inspiration of sierre\u00f1a music as played by its most important practitioner: the late, chart-topping Regional Mexican artist Ariel Camacho with Los Plebes del Rancho. After his passing in 2015, a gap remained in the genre. When Eslabon Armado formed (they were named by Pedro and Bryan's father, an amateur songwriter), they pursued a slightly different approach. They sought to create an alternative music that melded various instruments, all while based on the guitar approach of the sierra style. The trio released live videos to YouTube and other social media channels. Unbeknownst to them, their videos and songs had been heard by Del Records' boss and impresario, \u00c1ngel del Villar. He sought them out and signed them before any other label could.\n\nThe band's first single and video for \"Con Tus Besos\" (a song Pedro Tovar felt was not up to snuff) was issued in late March 2020. It peaked at number 21 on the Hot Latin Songs charts and at 16 on the Latin Streaming Songs list a week later. In May, Eslabon Armado issued their debut long player, Tu Veneno Mortal. The ten-song set, which wove mariachi and banda horns into some songs, entered the Regional Mexican albums chart at number two -- it eventually reached number one -- and the Top Latin Albums list at seven. The group followed the release in June with the non-album single and video \"La Trokita.\" The latter rang up over a million views in its first two weeks of release.\n\nVibras de Noche\nJust five months later, they followed with the 14-song Vibras de Noche, which reached number one at both Latin Albums and Mexican Regional Albums and peaked at 18 on the Top 200. In December, they struck again with the 22-track Corta Venas, their third chart-topping Mexican Regional Albums entry in three tries; the recording also placed at two on the Latin Albums list and reached number 56 on the Top 200. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eslabon+Armado\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Brazilian composer, producer and keyboardist, Corciolli was born on the 8th of January, 1968, in S\u00e3o Paulo. He always loved the sounds that electronic synthesizers can produce and at the age of 13, he began to take piano classes with Mrs. Nair Talbet (disciple of Magdalena Tagliaferro). Later he started playing in several bands and under the orientation of Mr. Cacho Souza he expanded his knowledge of popular music and jazz. In the year of 1986 he started the Architecture\u00b4s College and work as a professional musician as well. At that time he was playing with the virtuoso bass player Celso Pixinga and with the rhumba-flamenco blockbuster\u00b4s band Espirito Cigano.\n\nIn 1995, inspired by ancient Latin texts and studies on alchemy, he produced one of his most famous work, the album \u201cUnio Mystica\u201d. This great album has a singular mixture of Gregorian chant, ethereal piano melodies and good arrangement. This album was released in several countries and achieved a great success with the audiences and critics. It also received the blessing of His Holiness, Pope John Paul II In 1996 Corciolli played at the America Latina memorial with the Tibetan Monks of Gaden Shartse. With the same group he recorded the album \u201cThe New Moon Of East\u201d. This album was an Innovative meeting of Tibetan sacred chants with music made by a Western artist. In the following years, he produced and released several albums as a solo artist and several special projects for the recording company such as \u201cExotique\u201d (1998), \u201cUnio Celestia\u201d(1999) and \u201cTudoAzul\u201d collection (2001): 10 albums inspired on the main alternative therapies and ancient knowledge. The song \u201cOratio\u201d (album Unio Celestia) has been chosen to be the musical theme of the soap opera \u201cEssas Mulheres\u201d. The song \u201cToledo\u201d (album Unio Celestia) has been chosen to be part of the song track for the presentation of the Brazilian gymnast Ang\u00e9lica Kvieczynski at Panamericanos games of 2007. Invited by Caras Magazine, one of the most important magazine in Brazil, he produced two best-sellers collections: \u201cCaras Zen\u201d and \u201cCaras M\u00fasica do Mundo\u201d that sold more than 8 millions CDs. \n\nCorciolli has released many international compilations in more than 40 different countries. He worked with artists such as Hans Zimmer, Vangelis, Enigma, Sarah Brightman, Luciano Pavarotti among others. Nowadays, Corciolli is working with soundtrack composition for cinema and new artist production.

          "Roberto Carlos (born April 19, 1941 in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil) initiated a major revolution of customs in Brazil in the '60s. Reaching success in a period coinciding with the youth movement started by the The Beatles that was taking over the world, Carlos was the leader of Jovem Guarda (\"Young Guard\") . He led the TV show that became a generic denomination of a musical style and what was a definitive change of face to the Brazilian phonographic market and of the very art of marketing itself (with the advent of an aggressive merchandising of the JG's top figures, including films, clothes, etc.), encompassing deep behavioral/gestual/language influences widespread through his entire generation. His light music, derived from British pop, and his (and his partner's Erasmo Carlos) lyrics (happy, humorous, and full of fashionable youth slang and na\u00efve though unexpectedly sexual) were deeply contrasting to the serious MPB, with its somber images and protest songs. After all, Brazil was living in a dark period of the military dictatorship, or the \"years of lead\" as they became known. \n\nA few years later, in the late '60s, Carlos (counseled by his advisers) changed his style to become the most successful romantic artist in Brazil. Having written (always with Erasmo Carlos) some of the most beautiful songs in this style (such as \"Detalhes,\" \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" etc.), Carlos accumulated virtually all possible accomplishments as a highly successful artist, including a solid international career with awards like the Grammy and top positions on Billboard's Latin charts. Though the adherence to a worn-out sentimental formula proved to be affective in commercial terms (more than 70 million albums sold in his career), it ultimately led him to be known, in the '80s and '90s, as a cheesy artist by youngsters and part of the adult listeners. Nevertheless, the mid-'90s witnessed a resurgence of Jovem Guarda talents through tributes of new rockers and Carlos reached the 21st century uncontestedly enjoying his absolute title: the King. \n\nRoberto Carlos was from a lower-middle-class family. At six, he lost one of his legs and began using a prosthesis. At nine, he debuted on his home city's local radio. In 1955, he moved to Niter\u00f3i (Rio de Janeiro) and then to Lins de Vasconcelos (a suburb of Rio de Janeiro), where he started to get into rock through Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard, at the same time he met Carlos Imperial, also from his hometown, who, as a TV and radio producer, would be of considerable importance to Carlos's early professional years. Two years later, Carlos performed at TV Tupi, singing \"Tutti Frutti\" (R. Penniman/J. Lubin/D. La Bostrie). In that period, he was scheduled to open a Bill Haley show at the Maracanazinho (Rio), when he became acquainted with Erasmo Carlos (then Erasmo Esteves). In 1958, Carlos met the \"Matoso gang,\" as were known the future artists Tim Maia, Jorge Ben, and the same Erasmo Esteves, among others, who would meet at Matoso Street at Tijuca (a neighborhood of Rio). Carlos, Erasmo, and Tim Maia (together with Edson Trindade, Arl\u00eanio L\u00edvio, and Jos\u00e9 Roberto \"China\") formed the group the Snacks (later the Sputniks), playing balls and performing on TV (including at Carlos Imperial's Clube do Rock on TV Continental, where Carlos was already a regular). The group was soon dissolved due to the incompatibility between Carlos and Maia.\n\nAfter working as an extra in several films such as Ag\u00fcenta o Roj\u00e3o and Minha Sogra \u00e9 da Pol\u00edcia (in which they backed up Cauby Peixoto on one song), Carlos and Erasmo played together in Erasmo's quartet the Snakes until Carlos was called by Imperial to take Carlos Lyra's place in the Os Terr\u00edveis band that played Elvis Presley covers on TV shows and live performances contracted by Imperial. \n\nSoon, Carlos left the band to try to become a bossa nova artist. Strongly influenced by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in that period, Carlos often tried to \"sit-in\" at the famous temples Plaza nightclub and the clubs of the Beco das Garrafas, but to no avail. A testimony of his ephemeral and unaccomplished bossa nova phase is Carlos' first album, with \"Jo\u00e3o e Maria\" and \"Fora do Tom\" (both by Imperial). In August 1960, a new release was launched, again in the bossa vein, \"Brotinho Sem Ju\u00edzo\" and \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Nenhum\" (again, both by Imperial). At the same time, Carlos would participate regularly in shows presented by Imperial, Os Brotos Comandam (TV Continental and R\u00e1dio Guanabara) and Festa de Brotos (TV Tupi). In 1961, in the same year in which Carlos recorded his first LP (a derivation toward boleros and ballads, Louco por Voc\u00ea) that earned some acceptance at the time (3,500 copies sold in one year), he accepted the suggestion of the record company CBS and changed his style to youth music, starting to write songs with the composer/lyricist who would become his most important collaborator: Erasmo Carlos. The duo's first hit was Carlos' rendition for an Erasmo version of \"Splish Splash\" (Bobby Darin), having as the B-side another classic written by them, \"Parei na Contram\u00e3o.\" The album was recorded and launched in 1963 as Carlos' fifth 78 rpm, accompanied by Renato e seus Blue Caps. It sold 7,500 copies, a modest amount today, but it represented a considerable selling then and the milestone of a new time. \n\nIn 1964, the LP \u00c9 Proibido Fumar (backed by the Youngsters) had hits with the title track (by Carlos/Erasmo) and with Erasmo's version of \"Road Hog\" (Gwen/John D. Loudermilk), \"O Calhambeque.\" It sold almost 12,000 copies in 18 months and was considered high-selling then, but still behind the leader Carlos Alberto (a bolero singer), who was selling more than twice as much. Nevertheless, Carlos' nationwide success was ascending, with more and more invitations for TV and radio shows and CBS wanting to take him to Argentina. That year, Carlos recorded the same repertory in Spanish, also backed by the Youngsters, and the album Es Prohibido Fumar was released by the end of 1964 in Argentina. It was planned to also be distributed in Brazil, but as the military government considered anything in Spanish (the language of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara) dangerous to the country, the album was simply taken out of the catalog by the recording company. \n\nIn 1965, Carlos was elected the King for the first time by direct vote of the audience in a contest promoted by Ant\u00f4nio Aguillar on his Reino da Juventude show. Later, the title would be confirmed at the highly popular Chacrinha show and it would be his for life. \n\nIn the same year, Roberto Carlos Canta Para a Juventude broke all records established by the singer until then, by far surpassing Carlos Alberto and his Amor Perdido. Carlos' album reached fifth place according to IBOPE (a most-accredited public opinion research institute), however, it quickly fell several positions. In fact, he would only have an album at number one of the top parade by the end of the year, with his next LP. Until then, his rising success would sell over 20,000 copies of the double single with \"Hist\u00f3ria de um Homem Mau\" (reaching fourth place on the charts) and 50,000 copies of his single \"N\u00e3o Quero Ver Voc\u00ea Triste\", \n\nOn September 5, Roberto Carlos opened the legendary show Jovem Guarda as the main host and also featuring Vanderl\u00e9a and Erasmo Carlos by his side. The show gave the name and directives to the first musical scene produced especially for Brazilian youth, representing a major cultural/behavioral/commercial breakthrough. After the show debut, Carlos' popularity reached levels unimagined until then. Scoring hits in Argentina and Brazil, Carlos became the best-seller for CBS. A double single with \"A Garota do Baile,\" Carlos reached number two in November, behind the Beatles' \"Help!\" But his album Jovem Guarda, also launched in November, took only one week to push \"Help!\" out of number one on the Brazilian charts, selling almost 200,000 copies in one year. \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" became a nationwide hit and with the exception of brief periods of time, it reigned absolute at number one on the top parade during the entire first semester of 1966. After performing in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay \u2014 countries in which the Spanish version of \"O Calhambeque\" continued to have success \u2014 Carlos went to Europe in April 1966, singing in Portugal (where \"Calhambeque\" and \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" were in first place on Lisbon charts). Returning to Brazil, he soon departed for a tour that started in South America, then Central and North America, where he sang in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, then Europe (London, Paris, Berlin, and Lisbon). Roberto Carlos, released in December 1966 and went right to number one in the second week (remaining there until April 1967), sold 300,000 copies in less than a year. Also in 1967, Carlos starred the feature film Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura (whose soundtrack sold 300,000 copies, staying at number one from December 17 until June 1968; the film also broke all box-office records until then); won fifth place at the III FMPB (Festival of Brazilian Popular Music of the TV Record, S\u00e3o Paulo) with \"Maria, Carnaval e Cinzas,\" by Lu\u00eds Carlos Paran\u00e1 (reaching number one as a single in November); participated in the MIDEM Festival in Cannes, France; and won the Chico Viola trophy for the songs \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo pro Inferno\" and \"Esque\u00e7a\" and for the LP Jovem Guarda. In June of the same year, Carlos departed for a series of shows in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the U.S. In Italy, he participated in the Venice Song Festival. \n\nIn 1968, Carlos left Jovem Guarda, which due to his absence would soon cease to exist. His departure was a result of a mature decision to migrate from a youth idol profile to that of a romantic singer. In the same year, Carlos won the San Remo Festival (XVIII Festival della Canzone Italiana) with \"Canzone Per Te\" (Sergio Endrigo) and starred the film O Diamante Cor-de-Rosa (also a box office success), opening his own show Roberto Carlos \u00e0 Noite (TV Record) on March 15. As a romantic singer, Carlos had several hits in the 1970s that still had his creative impetus, such as \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"As Flores do Jardim de Nossa Casa,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Amada Amante,\" \"Detalhes,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" \"A Montanha,\" \"A Proposta,\" \"Al\u00e9m do Horizonte,\" \"Olha,\" \"Amante \u00e0 Moda Antiga,\" and \"A Ilha\" (all with Erasmo), along with \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea?\" (Ant\u00f4nio Marcos/M\u00e1rio Marcos), and two songs written by Caetano Veloso especially for him, \"Como Dois e Dois\" and \"Muito Rom\u00e2ntico.\" In that decade, Carlos also consolidated his international career doing regular shows in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. In the year of 1970, he did his first show at the prestigious Canec\u00e3o, which would be the first of his highly successful annual seasons at the most important Carioca hall in terms of media resonance. In the early '70s, Carlos became the top record-selling Brazilian artist, a position he would keep for many consecutive years. After 1976, his albums were selling over 1,000,000 copies. His 1977 album Roberto Carlos, with \"Falando S\u00e9rio,\" sold 2.2 million copies. His 1978 show also beat all records, with 250,000 spectators in six months throughout Brazil, while the album with \"Caf\u00e9 da Manh\u00e3,\" \"For\u00e7a Estranha,\" and \"Lady Laura\" sold 1.5 million copies.\n\nIn the '80s, Carlos also started to record in English and French (he had already recorded albums in Spanish, Italian, and, naturally, Portuguese), having won the Globo de Cristal trophy, awarded by CBS to Brazilian artists who sell more than five million copies outside Brazil. At the same time, his albums continued to break records in his country. \"Caminhoneiro\" (1984) was aired 3,000 times in a single day, another record soon beaten by his own \"Verde e Amarelo\" (1985), with 3,500 spins. In 1986, he had success at Radio City Music Hall (New York, NY) and, two years later, won the Grammy as the Best Latin American Pop singer. In 1989, his Sonrie reached first place on Billboard's Latin chart. \n\nIn the 1990s, Roberto Carlos became the first Latin American artist to sell more albums than the Beatles (in 1994, having by then sold over 70 million copies of his albums). In the mid-'90s, with the retro Jovem Guarda wave, Carlos, who was worn out among the younger generations who had only known his romantic and sentimental hits directed at a middle-aged audience, had his importance recuperated by young rockers such as C\u00e1ssia Eller, Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho, and Skank, who recorded Rei, a tribute to him with his old Jovem Guarda hits. \n\nIn 1998, his second wife Maria Rita discovered she had cancer (she would die in 1999), which shattered his peace of mind. Trying to keep on with his career, Carlos continued to record and perform after one year of reclusion. In 2001, he broke his contract with Sony (ex-CBS), the recording company through which he had released a vast majority of his albums, due to commercial reasons related to his wife's demise.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roberto+Carlos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Steven Paul \"Elliott\" Smith (August 6, 1969 \u2013 October 21, 2003) was an American songwriter and musician. Smith was born in Omaha, Nebraska, raised primarily in Texas, and resided for a significant portion of his life in Portland, Oregon, where he first gained popularity. His primary instrument was the guitar, but he was also proficient at piano, clarinet, bass, drums and harmonica. Smith had a distinctive vocal style characterized by his \"whispery, spiderweb-thin delivery\" and use of multi-tracking to create vocal harmonies.\n\nAfter playing in the rock band Heatmiser for several years, Smith began his solo career in 1994 with releases on the independent record labels Cavity Search and Kill Rock Stars. In 1997 he signed a contract with DreamWorks Records, for which he recorded two albums. Smith rose to mainstream prominence when his song \"Miss Misery\", included in the soundtrack for the film Good Will Hunting, was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Song category in 1997.\n\nSmith battled with depression, alcoholism and drug addiction for years, and these topics often appeared in his lyrics. At age 34, he died in Los Angeles, California from two stab wounds to the chest. The autopsy evidence was inconclusive as to whether the wounds were self-inflicted. At the time of his death, Smith was working on his sixth studio album, From a Basement on the Hill, which was released posthumously on October 19, 2004.\n\nEarly life\n\nSteven Paul Smith was born at Clarkson Hospital in Omaha, Nebraska. His mother, Bunny Welch (n\u00e9e Bunny Kay Berryman), was a music teacher at an elementary school, and his father, Gary Smith, was a University of Nebraska medical student at the time. His parents divorced about a year later, and Smith moved with his mother to live in Duncanville, Texas. Much later in his life, Smith got a tattoo of a map of Texas on his upper arm and said, \"I didn't get it because I like Texas, kinda the opposite. But I won't forget about it although I'm tempted to 'cause I don't like it there.\" Smith endured a difficult childhood and a troubled relationship with his stepfather Charlie. Smith reflected the impact of this part of his life in the lyrics of \"Some Song\": \"Charlie beat you up week after week, and when you grow up you're going to be a freak.\" The name \"Charlie\" also appeared in the lyrics for \"Flowers for Charlie\" and \"No Confidence Man\". The family was a part of the Community of Christ through much of Smith's childhood, but eventually began attending services at a local Methodist Church. Smith felt that going to church did little for him, except make him \"really scared of hell\". In a 2001 interview, he stated, \"I don't necessarily buy into any officially structured version of spirituality. But I have my own version of it\". At the age of nine, Smith began playing the piano, and at ten began learning guitar on a small acoustic guitar bought for him by his father. At this age he also composed an original piano piece, \"Fantasy,\" which won him a prize at an arts festival. Many of the people on his mother's side of the family were non-professional musicians; his grandfather was a Dixieland drummer and his grandmother sang in a glee club.\n\nAt 14, Smith moved from Texas to Portland, Oregon, to live with his father, who was then working as a psychiatrist. It was around this time that Smith first began trying drugs and alcohol with friends as well as experimenting with recording for the first time, borrowing a four-track recorder. During high school, Smith played clarinet in the school band and also played guitar, piano and sang in the bands Stranger Than Fiction, A Murder of Crows and The Greenhouse, billed as either Steven Smith or \"Johnny Panic\". He graduated from Lincoln High School as a National Merit Scholar.\n\nAfter graduation, Steven Smith began calling himself \"Elliott\", saying that he thought \"Steve\" sounded too much like a \"jock\" name, and that \"Steven\" sounded \"too bookish\". Biographer S. R. Shutt speculates that it was either inspired by Elliott Avenue, a street that Smith had lived on in Portland, or that it was suggested by his then-girlfriend. A junior high acquaintance of Smith speculates that it was so as not to be confused with Steve Smith, the drummer of Journey.\n\nHeatmiser\n\nSmith graduated from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, in 1991 with a degree in philosophy and political science. \"Went straight through in four years,\" he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. \"I guess it proved to myself that I could do something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance to go to college and you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day.\" After he graduated he \"worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor\u2019s degree in philosophy and legal theory.\" While at Hampshire, Smith formed the band Heatmiser with classmate Neil Gust. After graduating from Hampshire, the band added drummer Tony Lash and bassist Brandt Peterson and began performing around Portland in 1992. The group released the albums Dead Air (1993) and Cop and Speeder (1994) as well as the Yellow No. 5 EP (1994) on Frontier Records, and were then signed to Virgin Records to release what became their final album Mic City Sons (1996).\n\nSmith had begun his solo career while still in Heatmiser, and the success of his first two releases created distance and tension with his band. Heatmiser disbanded prior to Mic City Sons' release, prompting Virgin to put the album out inauspiciously through its independent arm, Caroline Records. A clause in Heatmiser's record contract with Virgin meant that Smith was still bound to it as an individual. The contract was later bought-out by DreamWorks prior to the release of his album, XO.\n\nRoman Candle\n\nHis first release, Roman Candle (1994), came about when Smith's girlfriend at the time convinced him to send a tape of \"the most recent eight songs that [he\u2019d] recorded on borrowed four-tracks and borrowed guitar\" to Cavity Search Records. Owner Christopher Cooper immediately requested to release the entire album of songs, which surprised Smith, as he was only expecting a deal for a seven-inch record. Regarding the record, Smith said \"I thought my head would be chopped off immediately when it came out because at the time it was so opposite to the grunge thing that was popular. [...] The thing is that album was really well-received, which was a total shock, and it immediately eclipsed Heatmiser unfortunately.\" Smith felt his solo songs were not representative of the music Heatmiser was making: \"The idea of playing [my music] for people didn't occur to me... because at the time it was the Northwest \u2013 Mudhoney and Nirvana \u2013 and going out to play an acoustic show was like crawling out on a limb and begging for it to be sawed off.\" The instrumentation of the recordings was primarily acoustic guitar, occasionally accompanied by brief electric guitar riffs or a small drum set played with brushes. Only the final track, an instrumental titled \"Kiwi Maddog 20/20\" (a reference to the bum wine MD 20/20), had full band instrumentation.\n\nSmith's debut solo performance was at the now-defunct Umbra Penumbra on September 17, 1994. Only three songs from Roman Candle were performed, with the majority of the ten-song set comprised of B-sides, Heatmiser tunes, and unreleased tracks. Soon after this performance, he was asked to open for Mary Lou Lord on a week-long U.S. tour. Several more short tours followed, and Smith helped her record one of his songs \"I Figured You Out\", which he once called \"a stupid pop song [written] in about a minute\" that he discarded for \"[sounding] like the fucking Eagles.\"\nElliott Smith and Either/Or\n\nIn 1995, the self-titled album Elliott Smith was released on Kill Rock Stars; the record featured a similar style of recording to Roman Candle, but not without hints of growth and experimentation. Though the majority of the album was recorded by Smith alone, friend and Spinanes vocalist Rebecca Gates sang harmony vocals on \"St. Ides Heaven\", and Heatmiser guitarist Neil Gust played guitar on \"Single File\". Several songs made reference to drugs, but Smith explained that he used the theme of drugs as a vehicle for conveying dependence rather than the songs being about drugs specifically. Looking back, Smith felt that the album's pervasive mood gave him \"a reputation for being a really dark, depressed person,\" and said that he later made a conscious move toward more diverse moods in his music.\n\nIn 1996, filmmaker Jem Cohen recorded Smith playing acoustic songs for the short film Lucky Three: an Elliott Smith Portrait. Two of these songs would appear on his next album, Either/Or, another Kill Rock Stars release that came out in 1997 to favorable reviews. The album found Smith venturing further into full instrumentation, with several songs containing bass, drums, keyboards and electric guitars, all played by Smith. The album title was derived from the two-volume book of the same name by Danish philosopher S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, which deals with such themes as existential despair, dread, death and God.\n\nBy this time, Smith's already-heavy drinking was now being compounded with use of anti-depressants. At the end of the Either/Or tour, an intervention was staged by close friends of his in Chicago, but it proved ineffective.\n\nMiss Misery and the Oscars\n\nIn 1996, Smith was tapped by director and fellow Portland resident Gus Van Sant to be a part of the soundtrack to his film, Good Will Hunting. Smith recorded an orchestral version of \"Between the Bars (Orchestral)\" with acclaimed composer Danny Elfman for the movie. Smith also contributed a new song, \"Miss Misery,\" and three other previously released tracks (\"No Name #3\", from Roman Candle, and \"Angeles\" and \"Say Yes\", from Either/Or). The film was a commercial and critical success, and Smith was nominated for an Academy Award for \"Miss Misery\". Not eager to step into the limelight, he only agreed to perform the song at the ceremony after the producers informed him that his song would be played live that night \u2014 either by him or another musician of their choosing.\n\nOn March 5, 1998, Smith made his network television debut on Late Night With Conan O'Brien performing \"Miss Misery\" solo on acoustic guitar. A few days later, wearing a white suit, he played an abridged version of the song at the Oscars, accompanied by the house orchestra. James Horner and Will Jennings won the award that night for best song with \"My Heart Will Go On\" (sung by Celine Dion) from the film Titanic. Smith did not voice disappointment about not winning the award.\n\nSmith commented on the surrealism of the Oscars experience: \"That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy performing almost as much as I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was a lot of people who didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but it was fun to walk around on the moon for a day.\"\nXO and Figure 8\n\nIn 1998, after the success of Either/Or and \"Miss Misery\", Smith signed to a bigger independent record label, DreamWorks Records. Around the same time, Smith fell into depression, speaking openly of considering suicide, and on at least one occasion made a serious attempt at ending his own life. While in North Carolina, he became severely intoxicated and ran off a cliff. He landed on a tree, which badly impaled him but broke his fall. When questioned about his suicide attempt, he told an interviewer, \"Um, yeah \u2013 I jumped off a cliff. But it didn't work.\" Christopher Cooper, head of Cavity Search Records (which released Roman Candle), said about this time in Smith's life: \"I talked him out of thinking that he wanted to kill himself numerous times when he was in Portland. I kept telling him that he was a brilliant man, and that life was worth living, and that people loved him.\" Smith's first release for DreamWorks was later that year. Titled XO, it was produced by the team of Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock. XO also contained some instrumentation from Los Angeles musicians Joey Waronker and Jon Brion. It contained a more full-sounding, baroque pop sound than any of his previous efforts, with songs featuring a horn section, Chamberlins and elaborate string arrangements and even a drum loop on the song \"Independence Day\". His familiar double-tracked vocal and acoustic guitar style was still apparent. The album went on to peak at number 104 on the Billboard 200 and sold 400,000 copies (more than double that of each of his two Kill Rock Stars releases), becoming the best-selling release of his career. Smith's backing band during most of this period was the Portland-based group Quasi, consisting of former bandmate Sam Coomes on bass guitar and Coomes's ex-wife Janet Weiss on drums. Quasi also performed as the opening act at many shows on the tour, with Smith sometimes contributing bass, guitar or backing vocals. On October 17, 1998, Smith appeared on Saturday Night Live and performed \"Waltz #2.\" His backing band for this appearance was John Moen, Jon Brion, Rob Schnapf and Sam Coomes.\n\nIn response to whether the change to a bigger record label would influence his creative control, Smith said: \"...sometimes people look at major labels as simply money-making machines, they're actually composed of individuals who are real people, and there's a part of them that needs to feel that part of their job is to put out good music.\" Smith also claimed in another interview that he never read his reviews for fear that they would interfere with his songwriting.\n\nFigure 8, which was released in 2000, featured the return of Rothrock, Schnapf, Brion, and Waronker, and was partially recorded at Abbey Road Studios in England. The album garnered generally positive reviews and peaked at number 99 on the Billboard 200. The album garnered praise for its power pop style and complex arrangements, described as creating a \"sweeping kaleidoscope of layered instruments and sonic textures.\" However, some reviewers felt that Smith's trademark dark and melancholy songwriting had lost some of its subtlety, with one reviewer likening some of the songs to \"the self-pitying complaints of an adolescent venting in his diary.\"\n\nAlbum art and promotional pictures showed Smith looking cleaned-up and put-together. An extensive tour in promotion of the record ensued, including television appearances on Late Night With Conan O'Brien and The Late Show With David Letterman. However, Smith's condition began to deteriorate as he had become addicted to heroin either towards the end of or just after the Figure 8 tour.\n\nFinal years and recording of From a Basement on the Hill\n\nA follow-up to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned to happen with Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded a substantial amount of music for the album, when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work up until that point. He later said: \"There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one that I just scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs.\" When Brion sent a bill for the abandoned sessions to DreamWorks, executives Lenny Waronker and Luke Wood scheduled a meeting with Smith to determine what went wrong with the sessions. The singer voiced what he believed to be intrusion upon his personal life from the label, as well as poor promotion for the Figure 8 album. The talks proved to be fruitless, and soon after, Smith sent a message to the executives, stating that if they did not release him from his contract, he would take his own life. In May 2001, Smith set out to re-record the album, mostly on his own, but with some help from David McConnell, a member of the band Goldenboy. McConnell told SPIN that, during this time, Smith would smoke over $1500 worth of heroin and crack per day, would often talk about suicide, and on numerous occasions tried to give himself an overdose. Steven Drozd (of The Flaming Lips) and Scott McPherson played a few drum tracks, Sam Coomes contributed some bass and backing vocals, but almost every other instrument was recorded by Smith.\n\nOne of the few highlights for Smith in 2001 was inclusion of his song \"Needle in the Hay\" in Wes Anderson's dark comedy The Royal Tenenbaums. The song plays during a suicide attempt. Smith was originally supposed to contribute a cover of The Beatles' \"Hey Jude\" for the film, but when he failed to do so in time, Anderson had to use The Mutato Muzika Orchestra's version of the track instead. Anderson would later say that Smith \"was in a bad state\" at the time.\n\nSmith's live performances during 2001 and 2002 were infrequent, typically in the Pacific Northwest or Los Angeles. A review of his December 20, 2001 show at Portland's Crystal Ballroom stated concern over his appearance and performance: his hair was uncharacteristically greasy and long; his face was bearded and gaunt; and during his songs he exhibited alarming signs of \"memory-loss and butterfingers\". The crowd would often have to shout out the lyrics (and in some cases, guitar chords) when Smith could not think of them.\n\nIn the first of only three concerts performed in 2002, Smith co-headlined Northwestern University's \"A&O Ball\" with Wilco on May 2 in Chicago. Smith's performance was described as \"undoubtedly one of the worst performances ever by a musician\" and an \"excruciating... nightmare\". A reporter for the online magazine Glorious Noise made the statement \"...it would not surprise me at all if Elliott Smith ends up dead within a year.\"\n\nOn November 25, 2002, Smith was involved in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a Flaming Lips/Beck concert. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. Assuming that Smith was homeless, the officers allegedly beat and arrested him and his girlfriend, Jennifer Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's hand and back were injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he \"saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn't want in a person. It's not like when you think of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner.\" Smith had attempted to go to rehab several times, but said he \"couldn't honestly do the first step... I couldn't say what you were supposed to say and mean it.\" In 2002, Smith went to the Neurotransmitter Restoration Center in Beverly Hills to start a course of treatment for his drug addiction. In one of his final interviews, he spoke about the center: \"What they do is an IV treatment where they put a needle in your arm, and you're on a drip bag, but the only thing that's in the drip bag is amino acids and saline solution. I was coming off of a lot of psych meds and other things. I was even on an antipsychotic, although I'm not psychotic.\" After his 34th birthday on August 6, 2003, he gave up alcohol, caffeine, red meat, refined sugar and his longtime (sometimes abused) regimen of psychiatric medication. Director Mike Mills had been working with Smith during his final years and described Smith's troubles and apparent recovery: \"I gave the script to him, then he dropped off the face of the earth\u2026 He went through his whole crazy time, but by the time I was done with the film, he was making From a Basement on a Hill and I was shocked that he was actually making music.\" With things improving for Smith after several troubled years, he began experimenting with noise music and worked on his girlfriend Jennifer Chiba's iMac with the intent of learning how to record with computers, noting that it was the only method with which he was still unfamiliar. Smith jokingly labeled his experimental way of recording \"The California Frown\" (a play on the Beach Boys' \"California Sound\"). He said of the songs: \"They're kind of more noisy with the pitch all distorted. Some are more acoustic, but there aren't too many like that. Lately I've just been making up a lot of noise.\" He was also in the process of recording songs for the Thumbsucker soundtrack, including Big Star's \"Thirteen\", and Cat Stevens' \"Trouble\". In August 2003, Suicide Squeeze Records put out a limited-edition vinyl single for \"Pretty (Ugly Before)\", a song that Smith had been playing since the Figure 8 tour. Steve Hanft described the last six months of Smith's life as being \"like the light at the end of the tunnel\" and was convinced that Smith was clean and recovered.\n\nDeath and reactions\n\nElliott Smith died on October 21, 2003, at age 34 from two stab wounds to the chest. According to girlfriend Jennifer Chiba, with whom he was living at the time, the two were arguing, and she locked herself in the bathroom. Chiba heard him scream, and upon opening the door, saw Smith standing with a kitchen knife in his chest. She pulled the knife out, after which he collapsed and she called 911. Smith died in the hospital with the time of death listed as 1:36 p.m. While Smith's death was originally reported as a suicide, the official autopsy report released in December 2003 left open the question of possible homicide. A possible suicide note, written on a Post-it, read, \"I'm so sorry\u2014love, Elliot. God forgive me.\" According to Pitchfork, producer Larry Crane reported on his Tape Op message board that he had planned to help Smith mix his album in mid-November. Crane wrote: \"I hadn't talked to Elliott in over a year. His girlfriend, Jennifer, called me [last week] and asked if I'd like to come to L.A. and help mix and finish [Smith's album]. I said yes, of course, and chatted with Elliott for the first time in ages. It seems surreal that he would call me to finish an album and then a week later kill himself. I talked to Jennifer this morning, who was obviously shattered and in tears, and she said, 'I don't understand, he was so healthy.\" The coroner's report revealed that no traces of illegal substances or alcohol were found in his system at the time of his death. The coroner did find anti-depressant and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder medications in his system, but at prescribed levels. With his death not being officially declared a suicide, a journalist noted that some have suspected foul play, but also that the authorities do not seem to be investigating the case further.\n\nSoon after his death, a fan memorial was initiated outside of Solutions Audio (4334 Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, California), the site at which the cover of the Figure 8 album was shot. Farewell messages to Smith were written on the wall, flowers were brought and photos, candles and empty bottles of alcohol mentioned in Smith's songs were left. The owner of Solutions has, as of April 2008, allowed the memorial to stand. Memorial concerts were held in several cities in America and England. A petition was soon put forth with intent to make part of the Silver Lake area a memorial park in Smith's honor. It received over 10,000 signatures, but no plans to go forth with the park have been announced. Another memorial is located inside Smith's former high school, Lincoln High, and was erected in July 2006.\n\nSince Smith's death, many musical acts have paid him tribute. Songs in tribute to, or about Smith have been released by Rilo Kiley (\"Ripchord\" and \"It Just Is\" on More Adventurous), Sparta (\"Bombs and Us\"), Ben Folds (\"Late\" on Songs for Silverman), Third Eye Blind (\"Elliott Smith\" on Symphony of Decay), Mary Lorson (\"Lonely Boy\" on Realistic), Rhett Miller (\"The Believer\" on The Believer), Earlimart (\"Heaven Adores You\" on Treble and Tremble), Pete Yorn (\"Bandstand in the Sky\" on Nightcrawler, a song jointly dedicated to Jeff Buckley), and Ginger Sling (\"Faith\" on the \"Room\" EP). Several tribute albums have been released since his death: To: Elliott From: Portland, Home to Oblivion: Elliott Smith Tribute, Remote Memory: A Tribute to Elliott Smith, A Tribute to Elliott Smith and The String Quartet Tribute to Elliott Smith.\n\nPosthumous releases\n\nFrom a Basement on the Hill, with almost four years in production, was released October 19, 2004 by ANTI- Records (a part of Epitaph Records). With Smith's family in control of his estate, they chose to bring in Rob Schnapf and Smith's ex-girlfriend Joanna Bolme to sort through and mix the album. Although predicted by Smith to be a double album (or a regular album with a \"bonus disc\"), it was released as a 15-track single album. Many of the darkest songs from the sessions (later leaked onto the Internet) were not included, such as \"True Love\" (which deals graphically with addiction and rehab), \"Abused\", \"Stickman\" and \"Suicide Machine\" (a reworking of the Figure 8 era unreleased instrumental, \"Tiny Time Machine\"). It is rumored that it was the family's wishes not to have these songs on the record, as they had the final say in what should and should not be released. Reviews of the album were mostly very positive, but some were more critical; The Onion's A.V. Club wrote that \"the album he left behind turns out to be messy, complicated, and unquestionably not his defining work...the album still earns its place\u2014not at the top, and unfortunately as a bookend\u2014in a jarringly important body of work.\" Elliott Smith and the Big Nothing, a biography by Benjamin Nugent, was rushed to publication and hit stores shortly after From a Basement on the Hill, barely beyond the first anniversary of the musician's death. Smith's family, as well as Joanna Bolme, Jennifer Chiba, Neil Gust, Sam Coomes, and Janet Weiss, all declined to be interviewed and did not support the publication of the book. It contained interviews with Rob Schnapf, David McConnell, and Pete Krebs. The book received mixed reviews, with Publishers Weekly remarking that while \"Nugent manages to patch together the major beats of Smith's life, he can offer little meaningful insight\" and that Smith's fans \"will be disappointed by this short and shallow biography.\"\n\nOn May 8, 2007, a posthumous two-disc compilation album entitled New Moon was released by Kill Rock Stars. The album contained 24 songs recorded by Smith between 1994 and 1997 during his tenure with the label. The songs consisted of demos, early versions, previously released b-sides and some unfinished tracks. In the U.S., the album debuted at number 24 on the Billboard 200, selling about 24,000 copies in its first week. The record received favorable reviews and was Metacritic's 16th best-reviewed album of 2007. A significant portion of the proceeds from album sales are to go to Outside In, a social service agency for low-income adults and homeless youth in Portland, Oregon.\n\nOn October 25, 2007, a book titled Elliott Smith was released by Autumn de Wilde, which consists of photographs, handwritten lyrics and \"revealing talks with Smith's inner circle\". De Wilde was responsible for the Figure 8 sleeve art, making a landmark and de facto Smith memorial of the Solutions Audio mural. A five-song CD featuring previously unreleased live recordings of Smith performing acoustically at Club Largo in Los Angeles was included in the release.\n\nMusical style and influences\n\nSmith was inspired by many artists and styles, including Big Star, Simon & Garfunkel,David Bowie,  The Kinks, Elvis Costello, Motown,  flamenco records, AC/DC, Scorpions, and Modest Mouse. Smith claimed to listen exclusively to select albums (such as The Marble Index by Nico) for months. Sean Croghan (a former roommate of Smith's and member of bands Jr. High and Crackerbash) said that Smith \"listened almost exclusively to slow jams\" in his senior year at college. Smith was also known to gain inspiration from novels, religion and philosophy. He liked classic literature, especially Samuel Beckett, T. S. Eliot, and Fyodor Dostoevsky (and other Russian novelists).\n\nSmith mentioned his admiration for Bob Dylan in several interviews, citing him as an early musical influence. He once commented: \"My father taught me how to play \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\". I love Dylan's words, but even more than that, I love the fact that he loves words.\" Smith covered Dylan's \"When I Paint My Masterpiece\" several times in concert.\n\nSmith was a dedicated fan of The Beatles (as well as their solo projects), once noting that he had been listening to them frequently since he was about \"four years old\" and also claimed that hearing The White Album was his original inspiration to become a musician. In 1998, Smith recorded and contributed a cover of the Beatles song \"Because\" to the American Beauty soundtrack, which can be heard during the closing credits of the film. Although this was the only Beatles song that Smith ever officially released, he is known to have recorded at least one other (\"Revolution (Beatles Cover)\", during the sessions for XO), and played many songs by both the band and the members' solo projects at live concerts. \n\nRegarding his songwriting, Smith said: \u201cThe way I think about it is... I don't really think about it in terms of language, I think about it more like shapes. That's an interesting thing to talk about but it's difficult. I'm really into chord changes. That was the thing that I liked when I was a kid. So, I'm not like a... I don't make up 'a riff' really. It's usually like... that sequence that has some implied melody in it or something like that.\u201d Smith said that transitions were his favorite part of songs and that he preferred to write broader, more impressionistic music closer to pop rather than folk music. Smith compared his songs to stories or dreams, not purely confessional pieces that people could relate to. When asked about the dark nature of his songwriting and the cult following he was gaining, Smith said he felt it was merely a product of him writing songs that were strongly meaningful to him rather than anything contrived. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elliott+Smith\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Official site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n\n    In 2009, Carminho sang \"Fado\". This was her fado, the one she owned since an early age, when she listened to her parents\u2019 records, when she witnessed the gathering of fado singers in her own house and when, still a teenager, she began to sing in the Taverna do Embu\u00e7ado. This \"Fado\" was the title of her first album, which was one of the most awaited albums in the new generation of fado singers: for those who had already heard Carminho, her talent was obvious, but they had to wait \u2013 until she finished her graduation, until she travelled the world, until she knew who she really was.\n\n    And her \"Fado\" became one of the most acclaimed albums in 2009.  It went Platinum \u2013 an enviable outcome for a debut album. With \"Fado\", Portugal surrendered to Carminho\u2019s voice and the doors of the world opened to her talent.  It was considered best album 2011 by Songlines magazine, she had shows in European capital cities, in Womex 2011 (Copenhagen) and in the UNESCO headquarters, in Paris, within the scope of Fado as World Heritage candidate. Then came the invitation to participate in Pablo Albor\u00e1n\u2019s album, which became a phenomenon of popularity in both Portugal and Spain.\n    It was about time that \u201cFado\u201d had a worthy successor. And it's just around the corner. On 5th March, Carminho reveals her \"Alma\" (Portuguese word for soul) with 15 new songs, an album again produced and directed by Diogo Clemente, again wisely combining cover versions and originals (in the special edition, the album has 17 songs and a DVD with Carminho live in concertin May 2011 at Lux Fr\u00e1gil, Lisbon.\n\n    The cover versions are less evident. Some not so well known songs by Am\u00e1lia (\"Cabe\u00e7a de Vento\"), Maria Am\u00e9lia Proen\u00e7a (\"\u00c0 Beira do Cais\") or Fernanda Maria (\"As Pedras da Minha Rua\"), but also from Chico Buarque (\"Meu Namorado\", de \"O Grande Circo M\u00edstico\") or Vinicius de Moraes (\"Saudades do Brasil em Portugal\"). The original songs are by Diogo Clemente (\"Bom Dia, Amor\", about poet Fernando Pessoa), M\u00e1rio Pacheco (\"Talvez\", lyrics by Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura), and Vitorino (\"Fado Adeus\"). And there are also some new lyrics for traditional fado tunes \u2013 one of them, \"Folha\", written by Carminho herself, and another one, \"Impress\u00e3o Digital\", a poem by Ant\u00f3nio Gede\u00e3o.\n\nAnd it is this mixture of past and present that allows us to unveil the future of Fado, in the unrivalled voice of Carminho. A voice which, in her second album, sustains all that Carminho sings in \"Talvez\": \"I might not know who you are, but I know who I am\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, she released a Tom Jobim covers album, titled \"Carminho Canta Tom Jobim\". \n\nOfficial site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carminho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "1)Gabriella Abreu Severino (born February 4, 2007), known professionally by her stage name Melody, is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, and musician. In 2022 she became the youngest artist in Latin America to reach the top of the Spotify Brazil chart with the song \"Pipoco,\" in collaboration with Ana Castela and Dj Chris No Beat.\n\nMelody is considered one of the most influential Brazilian children on the internet. Currently, her sister Bella Angel, who's two years older and also follows a musical career, writes and co-writes most of her songs.\n\nShe gained national notoriety in early 2015, after releasing a video on her Facebook page singing the song \"Fale de Mim\", a song written by her father, MC Belinho, who is also her manager. In a following video, she tried to reproduce a falsetto by Christina Aguilera that went viral.\n\n2) Melody (\u30e1\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3) was a three member Japanese pop idol group from 1993 to 1997 under the label Pony Canyon. \nThe group was formed in 1993 and got their name from the phrase \"Melody Heart\" (\u30e1\u30ed\u30c7\u30a3\u30cf\u30fc\u30c8). Their first single, \"Sunao ni Ienai ~Motto Soba ni Itai Kedo~\", was released in 1993 and was performed everywhere, including school festivals, with a large turnout. The group also became regulars on variety and music shows like Idol Station and M-STAGE. They also appeared in many commercials and each member would go on to act in various doramas.\nThe group sadly broke up in 1997 after their last Oh My Melody fanclub event for the release of the single \"Boom Boom My Heart (RADIO MIX)\". Wakasugi became a talent and a reporter for the show Doubutsu Kisou Tengai before retiring from show business and marrying years later. Mochizuki retired from show business altogether after the group broke up. But for Tanaka, she became an actress and had a brief singing career once the group broke up. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Melody\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "I DONT KNOW HOW BUT THEY FOUND ME is the solo indie act and brainchild of Salt Lake City artist Dallon Weekes. \n\nThe project is formed by Dallon Weekes (The Brobecks, Panic! at the Disco), with the initial collaboration of ex-drummer Ryan Seaman (Falling in Reverse) in 2016. They made some show in US cities as \"a band out of time. One who faded away into obscurity after struggling to find success in the late 70's and early 80's. Only recently, the internet has begun to uncover the performances and recordings of a band that the world wasn't ready for. Perhaps the world is ready now...\" during that year and in 2017 Dallon posted a video of him and Ryan that seemed like it was recorded in the 80s. \nSome more videos were released about a guy finding tapes of \"IDK\" on his attic and playing it on TV.\n\nOn August 18th, \"Modern Day Cain\" videoclip, the video of the tape, was released. This day is when the band became known by all his fans, not just the ones who saw the shows. Live videos leaked through the following months and on October 26th \"Choke\" was officially released. \n\nSince then, Dallon left Panic! for dedicating fully to his new project. On November 9th, 2018, the duo released their debut EP titled \"1981 Extended Play\".\n\nOn August 5, 2020, the band released a lyric video for a new song called \"Leave Me Alone\" with the announcement of their debut album titled \"Razzmatazz\", which is set to release on October 16, 2020.\n On September 16, the title track \"Razzmatazz\" was released, alongside a lyric video.\n\nOn September 30th, fans noticed the album release date on both Apple Music/iTunes and Amazon was suddenly moved a week after its original release, being the 23rd of October. Shortly, a day after, the band announced the change of date being moved from October 16th to October 23rd due to complications caused by Covid-19, along with the announcement of a new single, \"New Invention\", that was released on October 2nd.\n\nOn September 17th, 2023, the iDKHOW official accounts have announced on multiple social media\u2019s that Ryan Seaman will no longer be participating in the band, as well as celebrating their one million followers milestone on Spotify and Choke being certified Gold on US and Canada.\n\nOn October 5th, iDKHOW released their first original song in two years with \"WHAT LOVE?\", and announced their sophomore album, GLOOM DIVISION, due for release on February 23, 2024. Two more singles followed the track, with \"GLOOMTOWN BRATS\" and  \"INFATUATION\" releasing in advance of the album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/I+DONT+KNOW+HOW+BUT+THEY+FOUND+ME\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Official site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n\n    In 2009, Carminho sang \"Fado\". This was her fado, the one she owned since an early age, when she listened to her parents\u2019 records, when she witnessed the gathering of fado singers in her own house and when, still a teenager, she began to sing in the Taverna do Embu\u00e7ado. This \"Fado\" was the title of her first album, which was one of the most awaited albums in the new generation of fado singers: for those who had already heard Carminho, her talent was obvious, but they had to wait \u2013 until she finished her graduation, until she travelled the world, until she knew who she really was.\n\n    And her \"Fado\" became one of the most acclaimed albums in 2009.  It went Platinum \u2013 an enviable outcome for a debut album. With \"Fado\", Portugal surrendered to Carminho\u2019s voice and the doors of the world opened to her talent.  It was considered best album 2011 by Songlines magazine, she had shows in European capital cities, in Womex 2011 (Copenhagen) and in the UNESCO headquarters, in Paris, within the scope of Fado as World Heritage candidate. Then came the invitation to participate in Pablo Albor\u00e1n\u2019s album, which became a phenomenon of popularity in both Portugal and Spain.\n    It was about time that \u201cFado\u201d had a worthy successor. And it's just around the corner. On 5th March, Carminho reveals her \"Alma\" (Portuguese word for soul) with 15 new songs, an album again produced and directed by Diogo Clemente, again wisely combining cover versions and originals (in the special edition, the album has 17 songs and a DVD with Carminho live in concertin May 2011 at Lux Fr\u00e1gil, Lisbon.\n\n    The cover versions are less evident. Some not so well known songs by Am\u00e1lia (\"Cabe\u00e7a de Vento\"), Maria Am\u00e9lia Proen\u00e7a (\"\u00c0 Beira do Cais\") or Fernanda Maria (\"As Pedras da Minha Rua\"), but also from Chico Buarque (\"Meu Namorado\", de \"O Grande Circo M\u00edstico\") or Vinicius de Moraes (\"Saudades do Brasil em Portugal\"). The original songs are by Diogo Clemente (\"Bom Dia, Amor\", about poet Fernando Pessoa), M\u00e1rio Pacheco (\"Talvez\", lyrics by Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura), and Vitorino (\"Fado Adeus\"). And there are also some new lyrics for traditional fado tunes \u2013 one of them, \"Folha\", written by Carminho herself, and another one, \"Impress\u00e3o Digital\", a poem by Ant\u00f3nio Gede\u00e3o.\n\nAnd it is this mixture of past and present that allows us to unveil the future of Fado, in the unrivalled voice of Carminho. A voice which, in her second album, sustains all that Carminho sings in \"Talvez\": \"I might not know who you are, but I know who I am\u201d.\n\nIn 2017, she released a Tom Jobim covers album, titled \"Carminho Canta Tom Jobim\". \n\nOfficial site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carminho\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Soap&Skin is the experimental musical project of Austrian artist Anja Plaschg (born 5 April 1990).\nAnja Plaschg grew up in a small village called Gnas in south east Styria, where her parents have a farm. She has played piano since she was six. At the age of 14 she began violin studies and developed an interest in electronic music. She attended the Graz Polytechnic for Graphic Design, but dropped out at 16 and moved to Vienna shortly afterwards. There she studied art at the Academy of Fine Arts in the master class of Daniel Richter, but at 18 dropped out again.\n\nMusicians like Xiu Xiu, Cat Power, Bj\u00f6rk, Nico, Aphex Twin and composers like Sergei Rachmaninoff or Arvo P\u00e4rt have had a great impact on her music.\n\nAfter only playing a handful of concerts she was already being dubbed a \"Wunderkind\". In 2008 she played German singer Nico in the play \"Nico - Sphinx aus Eis\" by Werner Fritsch in Berlin and Vienna, performing several songs in it, including \"Janitor Of Lunacy\", from her first EP. \n\nHer first album, called \"Lovetune for Vacuum\", was released in March 2009. It received excellent reviews and placed in the Austrian Top 10. The album also achieved chart positions in Germany, Belgium and France. Music journalists have already claimed to see in her a new star of Austrian pop.\n\nIn 2010 her song \"Mr Gaunt Pt 1000\" was used in the television commercial for Ford's Mondeo. In the 2010 French film \"Mes ch\u00e8res \u00e9tudes\" (also known as \"Student Services\"), the song titled \"The Sun\" plays during the credits. Her tracks 'Brother of Sleep' and 'Marche Fun\u00e8bre' were used in the soundtrack for Universal Pictures thriller 'War Games: At the End of the Day' in 2010.\n\nThe death of her father in 2009 was a key element on her mini-album Narrow, which was released in February 2012.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Soap&Skin\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Official site (with long song extracts): www.carminho.net\n\n    In 2009, Carminho sang \"Fado\". This was her fado, the one she owned since an early age, when she listened to her parents\u2019 records, when she witnessed the gathering of fado singers in her own house and when, still a teenager, she began to sing in the Taverna do Embu\u00e7ado. This \"Fado\" was the title of her first album, which was one of the most awaited albums in the new generation of fado singers: for those who had already heard Carminho, her talent was obvious, but they had to wait \u2013 until she finished her graduation, until she travelled the world, until she knew who she really was.\n\n    And her \"Fado\" became one of the most acclaimed albums in 2009.  It went Platinum \u2013 an enviable outcome for a debut album. With \"Fado\", Portugal surrendered to Carminho\u2019s voice and the doors of the world opened to her talent.  It was considered best album 2011 by Songlines magazine, she had shows in European capital cities, in Womex 2011 (Copenhagen) and in the UNESCO headquarters, in Paris, within the scope of Fado as World Heritage candidate. Then came the invitation to participate in Pablo Albor\u00e1n\u2019s album, which became a phenomenon of popularity in both Portugal and Spain.\n    It was about time that \u201cFado\u201d had a worthy successor. And it's just around the corner. On 5th March, Carminho reveals her \"Alma\" (Portuguese word for soul) with 15 new songs, an album again produced and directed by Diogo Clemente, again wisely combining cover versions and originals (in the special edition, the album has 17 songs and a DVD with Carminho live in concertin May 2011 at Lux Fr\u00e1gil, Lisbon.\n\n    The cover versions are less evident. Some not so well known songs by Am\u00e1lia (\"Cabe\u00e7a de Vento\"), Maria Am\u00e9lia Proen\u00e7a (\"\u00c0 Beira do Cais\") or Fernanda Maria (\"As Pedras da Minha Rua\"), but also from Chico Buarque (\"Meu Namorado\", de \"O Grande Circo M\u00edstico\") or Vinicius de Moraes (\"Saudades do Brasil em Portugal\"). The original songs are by Diogo Clemente (\"Bom Dia, Amor\", about poet Fernando Pessoa), M\u00e1rio Pacheco (\"Talvez\", lyrics by Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura), and Vitorino (\"Fado Adeus\"). And there are also some new lyrics for traditional fado tunes \u2013 one of them, \"Folha\", written by Carminho herself, and another one, \"Impress\u00e3o Digital\", a poem by Ant\u00f3nio Gede\u00e3o.\n\nAnd it is this mixture of past and present that allows us to unveil the future of Fado, in the unrivalled voice of Carminho.

          "kets4eki (Pronounced \"kets-eh-key\") is a 19 year old singer-songwriter from Poland, born on June 13th 2005. He is part of a music collective FabFantasy, and Anarchist Sanctuary.\n\nKets gained popularity by sampling 2000s and 2010s songs, \"remixing\" them into rave and dance songs. He first made music under another name, between 2018 and 2021. He said that at the time he didn't know how to mix and didn't like the music, so he took all of his songs off streaming services and wiped everything he could off the internet.\n\nKets started working with wujek, making polocore songs together. During this time he significantly improved his skills. Wujek produced most of the songs and was sometimes also featured.\n\nKets' jump in popularity can be mainly paired with 6arelyhuman's Hands up!, where kets4eki got a feature on. This spread his name to a huge audience of listeners after it blew up on TikTok, and began climbing charts.\n\nKets oftenly works with asteria, who helps kets by producing, mixing and mastering most of his songs. They released their first album together on August 3, 2023, RAVE2DEATH and continued working together releasing songs such as ULTRA INSTINCT and pick & choose. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/kets4eki\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Isabela Cristina Correia de Lima Lima, known by her stage name IZA, is a Brazilian singer, songwriter, presenter and businesswoman. Born and raised in the neighborhood of Olaria in Rio de Janeiro, she is the daughter of music and arts teacher Isabel Cristina Lima and naval soldier Djama Leite Lima. Her parents are second cousins, which is why the singer was given the surname Lima twice. At age 6 she moved to Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, when her father was transferred to serve at the Natal Naval Base. During her childhood in the capital of Potiguar, she suffered racism for being one of the only black children in a private and traditional school in the city of Natal.\n\nIZA started singing in church at age 14 and began performing at parishes and other events when she returned to Rio de Janeiro at age 19.\n\nIn 2009, at the age of eighteen, she joined the Publicity and Propaganda course at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), with a scholarship from Enem, graduating in 2013 and starting to work as a video editor. In 2015, at the same time, she created a YouTube channel and started to publish videos singing songs by other artists.\n\nIn 2016, she was discovered by Warner Music through her YouTube channel and signed to the label. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/IZA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "Francisco, el Hombre is more than the personification of an old legend. The project began with Sebasti\u00e1n and Mateo Pirac\u00e9s-Ugarte, but truly spread it's wings when they got together with fellow musicians Andrei Kozyreff, Juliana Strassacapa, Erin O'Connor, Victor V-B and Andr\u00e9 Cardoso. Having perfectly mixed their Mexican roots with their Brasilian and American upbringing, the band embodies a global aspect which they themselves translate as \"noisy transamerican transculturalism\". The band is mainly influenced by Latin-American artwork, although the brothers' travels through Africa, Europe, North and South America presented them with larger perspective of this cosmopolitan spirit. While playing on the streets, squares, jungles and large venues, Francisco, el Hombre's contagious energy is unquestionable, regardless of the language they choose to sing in. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Francisco,+el+Hombre\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Renowned for the free improvisation in their performances and their enigmatic and mysterious atmosphere, the sound flows somewhere between the noisy and the melodic, an investigation of many musical genres \u2013 punk, dub, jazz, electronica, atonal music \u2013 creating melancholic and energetic songs in a single blow .\n\nThe group features in their discography an EP (\"self-titled\" released in 2014), the first full album (\"Lado Turvo, Lugares Inquietos\", released in 2016) and the latest release, the second album \"O C\u00e3o de Toda Noite\", released in October 2019. Over the span of six years since Maquinas was formed, its songs and performances have caught the attention and triggered the curiosity of new listeners outside Fortaleza. \n\nThe release of the first album led the band to make their first tour in the northeast (in 2016) and southeast regions of Brazil (in 2017), as well as having received invitations to perform in important venues of the Brazilian alternative music scene, having performed, for example, at the Feira da M\u00fasica (2016), Maloca Drag\u00e3o Festival (2017 and 2018) and at the S\u00e3o Paulo Cultural Center/CCSP (2018). With the recent release of their second album, the band now plans to be able to perform even more in 2020, and in even more diverse venues inside and outside the country. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maquinas\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

          "BTS\u00a0(Korean:\u00a0\ubc29\ud0c4\uc18c\ub144\ub2e8;\u00a0RR:\u00a0Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the\u00a0Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean\u00a0boy band\u00a0formed in\u00a0Seoul\u00a0in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a\u00a0hip hop\u00a0group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an\u00a0alternative universe\u00a0storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under\u00a0Big Hit Entertainment\u00a0and released their debut single album,\u00a02 Cool 4 Skool\u00a0(2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S.\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0entries\u00a0The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2\u00a0(2015),\u00a0The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever\u00a0(2016), and\u00a0Wings\u00a0(2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group.\u00a0Wings\u00a0became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the\u00a0Korean Wave\u00a0into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the\u00a0Recording Industry Association of America\u00a0(RIAA) with their single \"Mic Drop\". The band is the first Korean act to top the U.S.\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200 with their studio album\u00a0Love Yourself: Tear\u00a0(2018) and have since hit the top of the U.S. charts with their albums\u00a0Love Yourself: Answer\u00a0(2018) and\u00a0Map of the Soul: Persona\u00a0(2019), making BTS the first group since\u00a0The Beatles\u00a0to earn three number one albums in less than a year, and the fastest to earn three number one albums since\u00a0The Monkees\u00a0in 1967.\u00a0Love Yourself: Answer\u00a0also broke South Korea's\u00a0Gaon Album Chart's all-time monthly record previously set by\u00a0Love Yourself: Tear\u00a0and became the first Korean album certified Gold in the United States.\n\nAccording to\u00a0Gaon Music Chart, BTS has sold fifteen million albums domestically and is the best-selling artist to debut in the 2010s.\u00a0They hold the\u00a0best-selling album in Korean history\u00a0with\u00a0Map of the Soul: Persona. BTS were the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the\u00a0IFPI's Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart. The group has won\u00a0Top Social Artist\u00a0three years in a row and\u00a0Top Duo/Group\u00a0at the\u00a026th\u00a0Billboard\u00a0Music Awards. Featured on\u00a0Time's international cover as \"Next Generation Leaders\", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017\u20132019) and\u00a0Time's\u00a0100 most influential people in the world\u00a0(2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname 'Princes of Pop'.\u00a0Forbes Korea\u00a0named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the\u00a0Forbes\u00a0Celebrity 100\u00a0(2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. During their 2019\u00a0Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian artist ever to headline and sell out\u00a0Wembley Stadium\u00a0and broke the record for the single highest-grossing engagement in\u00a0Rose Bowl Stadium\u00a0history. BTS are worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, attracting one in every 13 foreign tourists that visit the country, and are cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018, a figure not seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum.\n\nFollowing the establishment of their\u00a0Love Myself\u00a0anti-violence campaign in partnership with\u00a0UNICEF, BTS addressed the\u00a0United Nations\u00a073rd\u00a0General Assembly\u00a0and became the youngest ever recipients of the\u00a0Order of Cultural Merit\u00a0from the\u00a0President of South Korea\u00a0due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/BTS\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
