Combining punk attitude with pop sensibility, Chyna creates a soundscape unique to any genre. In the early days of Chyna, both Peter Lee and Steve Zing's cousin Jon Carcich played rhythm guitar during live performances. Steve, Chris Marino (also known as Chris Morance), Jon, and Joseph Jay were all former members of Mourning Noise. Brian Aliano had previously been in The Undead, then known as Brian Payne.\n\n2) Chyna (born Joan Marie Laurer; December 27, 1970) is a former American professional wrestler, actress, pornographic actress and former bodybuilder. She is best known for her career with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) from 1997 to 2001, where she was billed as \"Chyna: 'The Ninth Wonder of the World'\" (Andr\u00e9 the Giant was already billed as the eighth). She began her WWF career as Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque's on-screen bodyguard, and the duo also dated in real-life. They were both members of the popular D-Generation X stable, a storyline alliance of several wrestlers, until 1999.\nChyna holds the distinction of being the only Diva in WWE history to compete, full time, in the men's division. She was the first woman to enter the Royal Rumble, qualify for the King of the Ring tournament, and be the number one contender for the WWF Championship. In 1999, she became the first and only woman to hold the WWF Intercontinental Championship, which she held twice. She also held the WWF Women's Championship once, before leaving the company in 2001. She claims that Levesque's affair with Stephanie McMahon, daughter of WWF owner Vince McMahon, was a factor in her departure. After originally retiring from professional wrestling in 2004, Chyna made a return in May 2011 by joining Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA).\nOutside of wrestling, Laurer has appeared in Playboy magazine twice, as well as numerous television shows and films. In 2005, Laurer was a cast member on VH1's The Surreal Life, which led to several other celebrity reality appearances on the network, including The Surreal Life: Fame Games in 2007 and Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew in 2008. She is also known for her tumultuous relationship with fellow wrestler Sean Waltman, with whom she made a sex tape. It was released in 2004 and entitled 1 Night in China. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Chyna\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is also the great-grandson of Francisco Moreno Fern\u00e1ndez, 1st Marquess of Albor\u00e1n, and has two siblings: Casilda and Salvador.\n\nFrom a very young age, he was interested in learning to play various musical instruments such as piano, classical guitar, flamenco guitar, and acoustic guitar, and attended singing lessons with professional artists in M\u00e1laga and Madrid. In 2002, at the age of 12, he composed his first songs, \"Amor de Barrio\" (Neighbourhood Love) and \"Desencuentro\" (Disagreement) which would be featured 10 years later on his debut album.\n\nIn M\u00e1laga he performed for the first time with a Flamenco band in a restaurant, and he was nicknamed El Blanco Moreno (The White Moreno), because he \"was very pale-skinned and Moreno was my family name\", as he stated in an interview in early 2011. Later, Pablo met producer Manuel Ill\u00e1n and recorded a demo, which included a cover of \"Deja de Volverme Loca\" (Stop Driving Me Crazy) by Diana Navarro. Upon hearing this recording, Navarro expressed great interest in Albor\u00e1n and became his musical mentor.\n\nIn preparation for his first album, Albor\u00e1n composed a total of 40 songs from which the playlist would be selected. During the recording of this studio album, Pablo Albor\u00e1n, he uploaded a few songs on YouTube, which gained the attention of many, including singer Kelly Rowland who was amazed by his voice, as far as saying \"I'm in love with Pablo Alboran!\". His videos have since received millions of views.\n\n\"Solamente T\u00fa\" (Only You) was digitally released in Spain in October 2010 as the first single of his debut album, which was released in February 2011. Both the single and the album were a huge success, managing to top the Spanish music charts for several consecutive weeks. The album won multiple awards, including 2011 RTVE's Album of the Year, and became Spain's best-selling album in 2011.\n\nAlbor\u00e1n began his first world tour on May 27, 2011 in Madrid at the Palacio Vistalegre, and has since performed in many Latin American countries, among which are Argentina, Chile and Mexico. Following his success, he released his first live album, En Ac\u00fastico, in November of the same year. It included acoustic versions of most of the tracks in his debut album, as well as two new songs and four bonus tracks. The song \"Perd\u00f3name\" (Forgive Me) was re-recorded featuring Portuguese singer Carminho, and was released as the first single of the album, peaking at number one on the Spanish singles chart on November 13, 2011, thus helping En Ac\u00fastico to debut also at number one on the albums chart one week later, on November 20, 2011, and to top the Portuguese Albums Chart in January 2012.\n\nIn December 19, 2011, Albor\u00e1n received the 2011 Best New Act award in Los Premios 40 Principales. Both his albums Pablo Albor\u00e1n and En Ac\u00fastico were featured in Spain's official list of top-selling albums of 2011, in numbers 1 and 6 respectively, and singles \"Solamente T\u00fa\" and \"Perd\u00f3name\" were the third and nineteenth best-selling songs in Spain in 2011. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Pablo+Albor%C3%A1n\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Moonspell is a Portuguese gothic metal band with elements of black metal. The group, founded in 1989 originally as Morbid God, was renamed Moonspell in 1992. With the release of their first album Wolfheart in 1995, the band quickly gained status and became one of the most recognizable metal bands from Portugal.\n\nThe band started out as folk-tinged black metal. In 1992, still under the name Morbid God, they released the promo track \"Serpent Angel\". In 1993, vocalist Fernando Ribeiro, drummer Mike Gaspar and bassist Jo\u00e3o Pedro released the demo Anno Satan\u00e6 under the name Moonspell, which caught the attention of French label Adipocere. It was for Adipocere that Moonspell released in 1994 a mini-album titled Under the Moonspell. The record was a considered a landmark in Portuguese metal and sold more than 5000 copies, becoming Adipocere's best-selling record at the time. Shortly after the release, they played with Cradle of Filth in a concert in Lisbon.\n\nBreakthrough (1995-1997)\nAfter the release of mini-album Under the Moonspell, Moonspell signed with Century Media for six CDs. Wolfheart was recorded in Germany with producer Waldemar Sorychta and was released in 1995 and was followed by a European tour. Although the album had little or no recognition at the beginning, it was later recognized as a \"milestone\" by heavy-metal reviews site Metal-Observer.com. During the tour, guitarist Mantus quit the band and was replaced by Ricardo Amorim.\n\nIrreligious came out in 1996 and was recorded again with producer Waldemar Sorychta. While previous album was considered black metal, this one fell into the genre of gothic metal. The song Opium became the first Moonspell single. It quoted one of Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa's heteronyms, \u00c1lvaro de Campos, on his poem \"Opi\u00e1rio\" and its music video, featured the character of poet writing in a bar with the band playing. Along with the release of the album in a convent, the Convento do Beato, there were factors that helped the band selling 10.000 copies of the album in their homeland.\n\nAfter conflicts with the band involving lawsuits, bass player Ares left the band and was replaced by S\u00e9rgio Crestana.\n\nExperimenting (1998-2000)\nSin/Pecado (Pecado means 'sin' in Portuguese) was released in 1998. It had a bigger experimental nature than its predecessors. The song 2econd Skin was released as a single. At the time they released the one and only Daemonarch album, Hermeticum. Daemonarch was a side project composed by all Moonspell members but drummer Mike Gaspar. The album was seen as a return to their black metal roots and its lyrics were all written by singer Fernando Ribeiro  between the age of 14 and 16.\n\nSin/Pecado was followed in 1999 by The Butterfly Effect, recorded in London and produced by Andy Reilly. This album is considered to be very experimental in nature as well. Featuring \"down-tuned guitar riffs, eerie synthesizer passages\", the album was mainly composed by guitarist/keyboard player Pedro Paix\u00e3o and was not very well received by metal critics.\n\n\"Darkness and Hope\" and \"The Antidote\" (2001-2005)\nDarkness and Hope was released in 2001 and was produced by Hiili Hiilesmaa, producer of Sentenced or HIM. The album reached 79th on German charts and special editions included covers of Madredeus, Ozzy Osbourne's Mr. Crowley and Joy Division's Love Will Tear Us Apart. Nocturna was released as a single and music video.\n\nIn 2003, the band released The Antidote, with Niclas Etel\u00e4vuori from Amorphis playing as a session musician on the bass guitar. The album was released with a book with the same title written by Portuguese writer Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Peixoto. Both the CD and book share the same concept and story and each song in the CD is sister to a chapter in the book that enhances the story in the lyrics. \"Everything Invaded\" was released as a single and music video. The band toured extensively around the world, playing at Rock in Rio Lisbon in 2004, a concert that brought them to more mainstream attention in Portugal. From this album on, the tours feature Aires Pereira on the bass.\n\nIn early 2004 the band recorded a cover of the jazz standard \"I'll see you in my dreams\" for the soundtrack of a Portuguese horror movie of the same name. There is an official music video of this song featuring footage from the film itself.\n\n\"Memorial\", \"Under Satanae\" and \"Night Eternal\" (2006-present)\nMemorial was released in 2006. Recorded with the producer of their first three albums Waldemar Sorychta, who also recorded the bass guitar parts, it was the first to be released under their new label SPV Steamhammer. The album topped the Portuguese album chart on its first week and also broke into the German Top 100 at number 68. Memorial achieved gold status in Portugal after selling 10,000 copies, making Moonspell the first Portuguese heavy metal band to achieve that.\n\nAlthough the album is heavier than the previous, it was very well received and its release was featured in various Portuguese news broadcasts. A new release of the album was released in December 2006 and featured a DVD with live performances and the music videos made for the album. Music videos for \"Finisterra\" and \"Luna\" were released.\n\nOn November 2, 2006, Moonspell won an MTV Europe Music Award in the category of Best Portuguese Act.\nThe Great Silver Eye, a best-of album, was released on June 26, 2007.\nRecently, Moonspell released Under Satan\u00e6, a re-recording of early songs.\nThe last album has been called \"Night Eternal\". It was released on May 16, 2008. Moonspell is slated to tour Danzig's 2008 incarnation of his Blackest of the Black tour.\nAfter a lot of legal troubles, Moonspell released their first Dvd \"Lusitanian Metal\" on December 8, 2008 in 3 different versions. The most complete one is composed of 2 Dvds, a Cd and a small booklet with photographs and introduction to the footage written by some of the members of the band. The first Dvd contains a show they played in 2004 in Katowice, also recorded on the Cd, a collection of all their videos until \"Everything Invaded\" and an interwiew shot in a Graveyard. The second dvd presents some live footage took from different tours from 1992 to 2005.\n\nCurrent members\nFernando Ribeiro - vocals (1989-present )\nRicardo Amorim - lead guitar (1995-present )\nPedro Paix\u00e3o - keyboards / rhythm guitar (1994-present )\nAires Pereira - bass (2004-present )\nHugo Ribeiro - drums (2020-present)\n\nPrevious members\nBaalberith - drums (1989-1992)\nJo\u00e3o Pedro (Ares / Tetragrammaton) - bass (1989-1997)\nLu\u00eds Lamelas (Malah / Fenrir) - guitar (1992-1993)\nMike Gaspar - drums (1992-2020)\nJ.M.

        "lastfm_content_song": "\"99 Luftballons\" is a Cold War-era protest song by the German band Nena. Originally sung in German, it was later re-recorded in English as \"99 Red Balloons\".\n\n\"99 Luftballons\" reached #1 in West Germany in 1983. In 1984, the original German version also peaked at #2 on the American Billboard Hot 100 chart and the English-language version topped the UK Singles Chart. The German version topped the Australian charts for five weeks and the New Zealand charts for one week.\n\nWhen it made the charts in the United States, most US radio DJs incorrectly assumed that \"99 Luftballons\" translated to English as \"99 Red Balloons\" and spoke the number 99 in English, saying \"Ninety-nine Luftballoons.\"\n\nThe translation of the title is sometimes given as \"Ninety-Nine Air Balloons\", however \"Ninety-Nine Balloons\" is also correct. A Luftballon is a colourful toy balloon, rather than a balloon for transport or research. The name is derived from Luft, German for air, but the meaning of Luft does not qualify the type of balloon. The title \"99 Red Balloons\" almost scans correctly with the syllables falling in the right places within the rhythm of the first lines of lyrics, with \"red\" replacing \"Luft\". The only difference is the missing counterpart to the German syllable \"und\" in \"Neunundneunzig\" (literally \"nine and ninety\"). <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nena/_/99+Luftballons\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In 1983 and 1984, their German-language song \"99 Luftballons\" (and its English version, \"99 Red Balloons\") reached number one in the singles charts of countries around the world.\n\nThe band released four studio albums: Nena (1983), Fragezeichen (1984), Feuer und Flamme (1985) and Eisbrecher (1986). With two english language albums: 99 Luftballons (1984) and It's All In The Game (1985). The band disbanded in 1987 without ever officially announcing their end.\n\n2) Nena is the stage name of German singer and actress Gabriele Susanne Kerner (born 24 March 1960 in Hagen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany). Nena was also the name of the band with whom she released the 1984 English recording of the eponymous band's most well-known song \"99 Red Balloons\" (orginally released in Germany in 1983 as \"99 Luftballons\")\n\nNena acquired her nickname, which means \"baby girl\" in Spanish, at the age of 3 during a vacation to Spain. Her first band was called The Stripes (1979). They had a very minor hit with the song \"Ecstasy\", but never managed to achieve broad success.\n\n3) The band Nena was formed with Nena (singer), Rolf Brendel (drums), Carlo Karges (guitar), Uwe Fahrenkrog-Petersen (keyboard) and J\u00fcrgen Dehmel (bass) in Berlin in 1981. Their first hit single, \"Nur getr\u00e4umt\" (\"Only In Dreams\"), came in 1982 after appearing on the German television program Musikladen.\n\nThe following year they released their self-titled first album, which contained the singles \"99 Luftballons\" and \"Leuchtturm\" (\"Lighthouse\"). \"99 Luftballons\" was a #1 hit in many countries (including the U.S.) and an English version of the song, \"99 Red Balloons\", was recorded, and retains some measure of cultural influence, being referred to in current music - the Guster track Amsterdam. The song also featured in an episode of Scrubs, Gilmore Girls the film, Grosse Point Blank, and most recently the movie Watchmen. Nena then released ? (Fragezeichen) in 1984, Feuer und Flamme (\"Fire And Flame\", means \"to be all for it\") in 1985, Eisbrecher (\"Icebreaker\") in 1986. \n\nNena started dating Swiss actor Benedict Freitag shortly after the breakup of the band in 1987, and together with him had a son, Christopher Daniel, who was born disabled due to medical mistakes made during the birth that caused Nena to go into cardiac arrest. He died at the age of 11 months. She later had twins with Freitag, Larissa-Maria and Sakias Manuel.\n\nAfter splitting with Benedict Freitag, Nena began a relationship with drummer and music producer Philipp Palm of Stuttgart, with whom she has two children, Samuel Vincent and Simeon Joel. The couple and the four children live together in Hamburg.\n\nThroughout the 1990's, Nena released solo albums, including some children's albums. In 1999, Nena voiced the character Lea in the animated film Tobias Totz und sein L\u00f6we.\n\nIn 2002, Nena celebrated her 20th stage anniversary with the album \"Nena feat. Nena,\" a CD of self-covers of old hits. This jubilee album meant an incredible comeback for Nena that has hardly ever been seen before in German music business. Nena's 2005 album \"Willst du mit mir gehn\" (\"Do You Wanna Date Me?\") quickly achieved platinum status as well. The first single from \"Willst du mit mir gehn\", \"Liebe ist\" (\"Love Is\"), shot to Number 1 in the German charts in early 2005.\n\n9th October 2007 Nena released the album \"Cover Me\", an album composed entirely of cover songs with songs both in English and German.\n\nIn 2007, she co-founded the school \"Neue Schule Hamburg\".\n\n4) Nena is also the artistic name of a young portuguese singer.\nMusically influenced by names like John Mayer, Taylor Swift, Sara Bareilles, The Chicks (ex-Dixie Chicks) or Maro, Nena began developing and writing songs from a very young age, tending to write her first song when she was just 12 years old. After the composition process, on the guitar, where lyrics and music are usually born simultaneously, love is a recurring theme.\nAlthough her professional training was in the area of \u200b\u200bcommunication, her passion and devotion to music occupied a central place in her life and, since 2019, Nena has dedicated herself professionally to this area. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nena\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The septet co-writes and produces much of their output. Originally a\u00a0hip hop\u00a0group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and psychological concepts and includes an\u00a0alternative universe\u00a0storyline. Popular for their live performances, the group have staged several world tours.\n\nThe group initially formed as teenagers under\u00a0Big Hit Entertainment\u00a0and released their debut single album,\u00a02 Cool 4 Skool\u00a0(2013). Subsequent work such as their first U.S.\u00a0Billboard\u00a0200\u00a0entries\u00a0The Most Beautiful Moment in Life, Part 2\u00a0(2015),\u00a0The Most Beautiful Moment in Life: Young Forever\u00a0(2016), and\u00a0Wings\u00a0(2016) helped establish BTS' reputation as a socially conscious group.\u00a0Wings\u00a0became BTS' first album to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the international music market, leading the\u00a0Korean Wave\u00a0into the United States and breaking numerous sales records, becoming the first Korean group to receive a certification by the\u00a0Recording Industry Association of America\u00a0(RIAA) with their single \"Mic Drop\".

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Carlos do Carmo (Lisbon, 21 December 1939 - Lisbon, 1 January 2021) was a Portuguese singer. He was one of the most iconic faces of Fado.\n He was the son of Luc\u00edlia do Carmo (one of the greatest fadistas of the 20th century) and Alfredo de Almeida, (bookseller and later entrepreneur in the hotel business). His parents were also the owners of the famous Lisbon restaurant \"O Faia\". One might say that Carlos do Carmo was raised in an artistic atmosphere. His parents' house in the old part of the city, Bairro Alto, was a place where intelectuals and artists gathered, some of the more prominent figures of Lisbon society at that time. He studied the hotel business in Switzerland. In 1964, Carlos do Carmo began one of the most solid careers in the artistic panorama of Portugal...\nWhen he returned to Lisbon from Switzerland he entered the hotel business with his parents,  and took the reigns  of \"Casa de Fado\" which they had founded, using all of the ideas and techniques that he learned in Switzerland. After the death of his father, Carlos do Carmo became the owner, and thanks to his merits and good luck, made \"Casa de Fado\" the best in Lisbon. But music was ever present in him, and he recorded one of his mother's songs, \"Loucura\", at the request of M\u00e1rio Sim\u00f5es almost on a lark. The success of this experience was so great that the destiny of  Carlos do Carmo could not possibly  be delayed a minute more. The opportunity to record his first album came quickly, and in 1964 he recorded \" Estranha Forma de Vida\". His way of singing was different, his personal style unmistakable, he was the one that fado was waiting for to carry on the tradition, and there was a certainty that a new star had been born. From that moment on, success was part of his life, each and every fado that he sang, every album he recorded, every performance he gave, corresponded with yet another hit. All of his albums up to the present day have been cherished and the sales of his television performances are now part of fado history, recognized for their high quality, and for the inovative spirit that each one transmits. \"Por morrer uma andorinha\", \"Duas l\u00e1grimas de orvalho\", \"Bairro Alto\", \"Gaivota\",\n\"Canoas do Tejo\", \"Os Putos\", \"Lisboa Menina e Mo\u00e7a\" e \"Estrela da Tarde\", are some of the biggest hits of his career. Because of a desire to maintain a purely artistic career for such a long time, his artistic references include quite diverse artists as Frank Sinatra, Jaques Brel, Elis Regina and Jos\u00e9 Afonso. The international circulation of his work was driven, as he always likes to affirm, \"By those Portuguese who leave my country in search of a better life, and who have passed my works in to the hands of entrepreneurs and cultural agents of the various countries where they reside\".\nHe has sung on 5 continents, his performances at the \"Olympia\"  in paris, the opera houses of Frankfurt and Wiesbaden, the Canec\u00e3o in Rio de Janeiro, the \"Savoy\" in Helsinki, the Audit\u00f3rio Nacional in madrid, the Teatro da Rainha in Haia, the theater of Saint Petersburgh, the \"Place des Arts\" in Montreal, the Tivoli in Copenhagen, and the Memorial da Am\u00e9rica latina in S\u00e3o Paulo are some of the finest moments of his career. His performances throughout Portugal at the Mosteiro dos\nJer\u00f3nimos,  the Funda\u00e7\u00e3o Gulbenkian, the Coliseu dos Recreios, the Casino do Estoril,\nand at the Centro Cultural de Bel\u00e9m make a difference in the cultural level of the country.\nThe number of honours and awards he has received to this day are innumerable, from being named an honorary citizen of the city of Rio De Janeiro, member of the honor of Claustro Ibero-Americano das Artes, to the diploma accorded him by the senate of Rhode Island in the U.S. for his contribution to the propagation of Portuguese music, to the golden globe. He also figures as a pioneer in the new Portuguese discography, due to his album \"Um Homem no Pa\u00eds\", the first cd to be edited by an artist in Portugal.\nCarlos do Carmo knows the importance of family life, he's been married since 1964 having 3 children, as fruit of this union, one daughter and 2 sons, who maintain a close relationship with him. It's not always easy to juggle life as a family man with the life of a world traveling artist. He persues the realization of this dream, because he considers the union of family to be important. He considers himself the first link in a chain of individual connections. He values being with friends, and enjoys making new friends, maintaining an high level of quality in his artistic life.\nCarlos do Carmo is an artist who has certainly already attained some of his goals, aiming for a public who holds him in high esteem, great respect, apreciating in him not only his qualities as a musician, but also those of an artist interested in the evolution of the music of his homeland, and who believes in the evolution of man as a creature who can embrace the whole world in it's diversity. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Carlos+do+Carmo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Roberto Carlos (born April 19, 1941 in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil) initiated a major revolution of customs in Brazil in the '60s. Reaching success in a period coinciding with the youth movement started by the The Beatles that was taking over the world, Carlos was the leader of Jovem Guarda (\"Young Guard\") . He led the TV show that became a generic denomination of a musical style and what was a definitive change of face to the Brazilian phonographic market and of the very art of marketing itself (with the advent of an aggressive merchandising of the JG's top figures, including films, clothes, etc.), encompassing deep behavioral/gestual/language influences widespread through his entire generation. His light music, derived from British pop, and his (and his partner's Erasmo Carlos) lyrics (happy, humorous, and full of fashionable youth slang and na\u00efve though unexpectedly sexual) were deeply contrasting to the serious MPB, with its somber images and protest songs. After all, Brazil was living in a dark period of the military dictatorship, or the \"years of lead\" as they became known. \n\nA few years later, in the late '60s, Carlos (counseled by his advisers) changed his style to become the most successful romantic artist in Brazil. Having written (always with Erasmo Carlos) some of the most beautiful songs in this style (such as \"Detalhes,\" \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" etc.), Carlos accumulated virtually all possible accomplishments as a highly successful artist, including a solid international career with awards like the Grammy and top positions on Billboard's Latin charts. Though the adherence to a worn-out sentimental formula proved to be affective in commercial terms (more than 70 million albums sold in his career), it ultimately led him to be known, in the '80s and '90s, as a cheesy artist by youngsters and part of the adult listeners. Nevertheless, the mid-'90s witnessed a resurgence of Jovem Guarda talents through tributes of new rockers and Carlos reached the 21st century uncontestedly enjoying his absolute title: the King. \n\nRoberto Carlos was from a lower-middle-class family. At six, he lost one of his legs and began using a prosthesis. At nine, he debuted on his home city's local radio. In 1955, he moved to Niter\u00f3i (Rio de Janeiro) and then to Lins de Vasconcelos (a suburb of Rio de Janeiro), where he started to get into rock through Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard, at the same time he met Carlos Imperial, also from his hometown, who, as a TV and radio producer, would be of considerable importance to Carlos's early professional years. Two years later, Carlos performed at TV Tupi, singing \"Tutti Frutti\" (R. Penniman/J. Lubin/D. La Bostrie). In that period, he was scheduled to open a Bill Haley show at the Maracanazinho (Rio), when he became acquainted with Erasmo Carlos (then Erasmo Esteves). In 1958, Carlos met the \"Matoso gang,\" as were known the future artists Tim Maia, Jorge Ben, and the same Erasmo Esteves, among others, who would meet at Matoso Street at Tijuca (a neighborhood of Rio). Carlos, Erasmo, and Tim Maia (together with Edson Trindade, Arl\u00eanio L\u00edvio, and Jos\u00e9 Roberto \"China\") formed the group the Snacks (later the Sputniks), playing balls and performing on TV (including at Carlos Imperial's Clube do Rock on TV Continental, where Carlos was already a regular). The group was soon dissolved due to the incompatibility between Carlos and Maia.\n\nAfter working as an extra in several films such as Ag\u00fcenta o Roj\u00e3o and Minha Sogra \u00e9 da Pol\u00edcia (in which they backed up Cauby Peixoto on one song), Carlos and Erasmo played together in Erasmo's quartet the Snakes until Carlos was called by Imperial to take Carlos Lyra's place in the Os Terr\u00edveis band that played Elvis Presley covers on TV shows and live performances contracted by Imperial. \n\nSoon, Carlos left the band to try to become a bossa nova artist. Strongly influenced by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in that period, Carlos often tried to \"sit-in\" at the famous temples Plaza nightclub and the clubs of the Beco das Garrafas, but to no avail. A testimony of his ephemeral and unaccomplished bossa nova phase is Carlos' first album, with \"Jo\u00e3o e Maria\" and \"Fora do Tom\" (both by Imperial). In August 1960, a new release was launched, again in the bossa vein, \"Brotinho Sem Ju\u00edzo\" and \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Nenhum\" (again, both by Imperial). At the same time, Carlos would participate regularly in shows presented by Imperial, Os Brotos Comandam (TV Continental and R\u00e1dio Guanabara) and Festa de Brotos (TV Tupi). In 1961, in the same year in which Carlos recorded his first LP (a derivation toward boleros and ballads, Louco por Voc\u00ea) that earned some acceptance at the time (3,500 copies sold in one year), he accepted the suggestion of the record company CBS and changed his style to youth music, starting to write songs with the composer/lyricist who would become his most important collaborator: Erasmo Carlos. The duo's first hit was Carlos' rendition for an Erasmo version of \"Splish Splash\" (Bobby Darin), having as the B-side another classic written by them, \"Parei na Contram\u00e3o.\" The album was recorded and launched in 1963 as Carlos' fifth 78 rpm, accompanied by Renato e seus Blue Caps. It sold 7,500 copies, a modest amount today, but it represented a considerable selling then and the milestone of a new time. \n\nIn 1964, the LP \u00c9 Proibido Fumar (backed by the Youngsters) had hits with the title track (by Carlos/Erasmo) and with Erasmo's version of \"Road Hog\" (Gwen/John D. Loudermilk), \"O Calhambeque.\" It sold almost 12,000 copies in 18 months and was considered high-selling then, but still behind the leader Carlos Alberto (a bolero singer), who was selling more than twice as much. Nevertheless, Carlos' nationwide success was ascending, with more and more invitations for TV and radio shows and CBS wanting to take him to Argentina. That year, Carlos recorded the same repertory in Spanish, also backed by the Youngsters, and the album Es Prohibido Fumar was released by the end of 1964 in Argentina. It was planned to also be distributed in Brazil, but as the military government considered anything in Spanish (the language of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara) dangerous to the country, the album was simply taken out of the catalog by the recording company. \n\nIn 1965, Carlos was elected the King for the first time by direct vote of the audience in a contest promoted by Ant\u00f4nio Aguillar on his Reino da Juventude show. Later, the title would be confirmed at the highly popular Chacrinha show and it would be his for life. \n\nIn the same year, Roberto Carlos Canta Para a Juventude broke all records established by the singer until then, by far surpassing Carlos Alberto and his Amor Perdido. Carlos' album reached fifth place according to IBOPE (a most-accredited public opinion research institute), however, it quickly fell several positions. In fact, he would only have an album at number one of the top parade by the end of the year, with his next LP. Until then, his rising success would sell over 20,000 copies of the double single with \"Hist\u00f3ria de um Homem Mau\" (reaching fourth place on the charts) and 50,000 copies of his single \"N\u00e3o Quero Ver Voc\u00ea Triste\", \n\nOn September 5, Roberto Carlos opened the legendary show Jovem Guarda as the main host and also featuring Vanderl\u00e9a and Erasmo Carlos by his side. The show gave the name and directives to the first musical scene produced especially for Brazilian youth, representing a major cultural/behavioral/commercial breakthrough. After the show debut, Carlos' popularity reached levels unimagined until then. Scoring hits in Argentina and Brazil, Carlos became the best-seller for CBS. A double single with \"A Garota do Baile,\" Carlos reached number two in November, behind the Beatles' \"Help!\" But his album Jovem Guarda, also launched in November, took only one week to push \"Help!\" out of number one on the Brazilian charts, selling almost 200,000 copies in one year. \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" became a nationwide hit and with the exception of brief periods of time, it reigned absolute at number one on the top parade during the entire first semester of 1966. After performing in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay \u2014 countries in which the Spanish version of \"O Calhambeque\" continued to have success \u2014 Carlos went to Europe in April 1966, singing in Portugal (where \"Calhambeque\" and \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" were in first place on Lisbon charts). Returning to Brazil, he soon departed for a tour that started in South America, then Central and North America, where he sang in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, then Europe (London, Paris, Berlin, and Lisbon). Roberto Carlos, released in December 1966 and went right to number one in the second week (remaining there until April 1967), sold 300,000 copies in less than a year. Also in 1967, Carlos starred the feature film Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura (whose soundtrack sold 300,000 copies, staying at number one from December 17 until June 1968; the film also broke all box-office records until then); won fifth place at the III FMPB (Festival of Brazilian Popular Music of the TV Record, S\u00e3o Paulo) with \"Maria, Carnaval e Cinzas,\" by Lu\u00eds Carlos Paran\u00e1 (reaching number one as a single in November); participated in the MIDEM Festival in Cannes, France; and won the Chico Viola trophy for the songs \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo pro Inferno\" and \"Esque\u00e7a\" and for the LP Jovem Guarda. In June of the same year, Carlos departed for a series of shows in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the U.S. In Italy, he participated in the Venice Song Festival. \n\nIn 1968, Carlos left Jovem Guarda, which due to his absence would soon cease to exist. His departure was a result of a mature decision to migrate from a youth idol profile to that of a romantic singer. In the same year, Carlos won the San Remo Festival (XVIII Festival della Canzone Italiana) with \"Canzone Per Te\" (Sergio Endrigo) and starred the film O Diamante Cor-de-Rosa (also a box office success), opening his own show Roberto Carlos \u00e0 Noite (TV Record) on March 15. As a romantic singer, Carlos had several hits in the 1970s that still had his creative impetus, such as \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"As Flores do Jardim de Nossa Casa,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Amada Amante,\" \"Detalhes,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" \"A Montanha,\" \"A Proposta,\" \"Al\u00e9m do Horizonte,\" \"Olha,\" \"Amante \u00e0 Moda Antiga,\" and \"A Ilha\" (all with Erasmo), along with \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea?\" (Ant\u00f4nio Marcos/M\u00e1rio Marcos), and two songs written by Caetano Veloso especially for him, \"Como Dois e Dois\" and \"Muito Rom\u00e2ntico.\" In that decade, Carlos also consolidated his international career doing regular shows in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. In the year of 1970, he did his first show at the prestigious Canec\u00e3o, which would be the first of his highly successful annual seasons at the most important Carioca hall in terms of media resonance. In the early '70s, Carlos became the top record-selling Brazilian artist, a position he would keep for many consecutive years. After 1976, his albums were selling over 1,000,000 copies. His 1977 album Roberto Carlos, with \"Falando S\u00e9rio,\" sold 2.2 million copies. His 1978 show also beat all records, with 250,000 spectators in six months throughout Brazil, while the album with \"Caf\u00e9 da Manh\u00e3,\" \"For\u00e7a Estranha,\" and \"Lady Laura\" sold 1.5 million copies.\n\nIn the '80s, Carlos also started to record in English and French (he had already recorded albums in Spanish, Italian, and, naturally, Portuguese), having won the Globo de Cristal trophy, awarded by CBS to Brazilian artists who sell more than five million copies outside Brazil. At the same time, his albums continued to break records in his country. \"Caminhoneiro\" (1984) was aired 3,000 times in a single day, another record soon beaten by his own \"Verde e Amarelo\" (1985), with 3,500 spins. In 1986, he had success at Radio City Music Hall (New York, NY) and, two years later, won the Grammy as the Best Latin American Pop singer. In 1989, his Sonrie reached first place on Billboard's Latin chart. \n\nIn the 1990s, Roberto Carlos became the first Latin American artist to sell more albums than the Beatles (in 1994, having by then sold over 70 million copies of his albums). In the mid-'90s, with the retro Jovem Guarda wave, Carlos, who was worn out among the younger generations who had only known his romantic and sentimental hits directed at a middle-aged audience, had his importance recuperated by young rockers such as C\u00e1ssia Eller, Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho, and Skank, who recorded Rei, a tribute to him with his old Jovem Guarda hits. \n\nIn 1998, his second wife Maria Rita discovered she had cancer (she would die in 1999), which shattered his peace of mind. Trying to keep on with his career, Carlos continued to record and perform after one year of reclusion. In 2001, he broke his contract with Sony (ex-CBS), the recording company through which he had released a vast majority of his albums, due to commercial reasons related to his wife's demise.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roberto+Carlos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Portuguese keyboard player and composer Jos\u00e9 Cid is mostly known in progressive rock circles for his 1978 concept album 10.000 Anos Depois Entre V\u00e9nus e Marte. It is a spacey symphonic rock trip into outer space, dominated by Mellotron, string synth, and other synthesizers, with supporting use of guitars, bass, and drums. Shortly after that he changed course to a pop approach in music, up until the present moment. Oddly enough, few of the people of his country (Portugal) know Cid by his greatest deeds in progressive rock history.\n\nEurovision Song Contest 1980 - The Hague\n\nPerformer: Jos\u00e9 Cid\nSong title: Um Grande, Grande Amor\nSong writer(s):\nSong composer(s): Jos\u00e9 Cid \n\nSang in Position:  14\nFinal Position:  7\nTotal Points:  71\n\nThe Hague was once more the host city for the song contest after both Israel and the United Kingdom declined to be hosts. Because of the fact that the 1979 winner, Israel, did not have the means of hosting the song contest again, the UK broadcaster BBC was asked if they would be willing to organise the event. They declined, so the Netherlands became the organiser despite the fact that there was not enough time left and Dutch TV NOS had to re-use most of the stage from 1976 when they hosted the contest last. NOS picked April 19th as the date for the song contest, but as this was the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel, the defending champion decided not to participate which marked the only time when the winner of one Eurovision Song Contest didn't participate in the next.\n\nFor the first time in the history of the song contest, an African country - Morocco - participated with Samira, a star in all of the Arabian countries, but when her entry Bitakat Hob ended up at 18th position with just 7 points altogether, Moroccan TV decided that the country should not participate in the contest again. \n\nTurkey returned to the contest after one year's absence and Monaco stayed home which meant that the total amount of participating countries amounted to 19 - just as in 1979. Each country brought along a presenter of its own choice along in order to introduce the song in their native language.\n\nThe Irish Johnny Logan who would later be called \"Mr. Eurovision\" secured Ireland's second victory. The Australian-born singer who only became an Irish citizen after he sang for Ireland in the 1980 contest, would later return and win the contest again in 1987. His 1980 victory brought him a number one hit in the UK and numerous television appearances across Europe. What's another year received seven times the maximum of 12 point votes, ending up with 143 points in total.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Jos%C3%A9+Cid\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Roberto Carlos (born April 19, 1941 in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, Esp\u00edrito Santo, Brazil) initiated a major revolution of customs in Brazil in the '60s. Reaching success in a period coinciding with the youth movement started by the The Beatles that was taking over the world, Carlos was the leader of Jovem Guarda (\"Young Guard\") . He led the TV show that became a generic denomination of a musical style and what was a definitive change of face to the Brazilian phonographic market and of the very art of marketing itself (with the advent of an aggressive merchandising of the JG's top figures, including films, clothes, etc.), encompassing deep behavioral/gestual/language influences widespread through his entire generation. His light music, derived from British pop, and his (and his partner's Erasmo Carlos) lyrics (happy, humorous, and full of fashionable youth slang and na\u00efve though unexpectedly sexual) were deeply contrasting to the serious MPB, with its somber images and protest songs. After all, Brazil was living in a dark period of the military dictatorship, or the \"years of lead\" as they became known. \n\nA few years later, in the late '60s, Carlos (counseled by his advisers) changed his style to become the most successful romantic artist in Brazil. Having written (always with Erasmo Carlos) some of the most beautiful songs in this style (such as \"Detalhes,\" \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" etc.), Carlos accumulated virtually all possible accomplishments as a highly successful artist, including a solid international career with awards like the Grammy and top positions on Billboard's Latin charts. Though the adherence to a worn-out sentimental formula proved to be affective in commercial terms (more than 70 million albums sold in his career), it ultimately led him to be known, in the '80s and '90s, as a cheesy artist by youngsters and part of the adult listeners. Nevertheless, the mid-'90s witnessed a resurgence of Jovem Guarda talents through tributes of new rockers and Carlos reached the 21st century uncontestedly enjoying his absolute title: the King. \n\nRoberto Carlos was from a lower-middle-class family. At six, he lost one of his legs and began using a prosthesis. At nine, he debuted on his home city's local radio. In 1955, he moved to Niter\u00f3i (Rio de Janeiro) and then to Lins de Vasconcelos (a suburb of Rio de Janeiro), where he started to get into rock through Bill Haley, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard, at the same time he met Carlos Imperial, also from his hometown, who, as a TV and radio producer, would be of considerable importance to Carlos's early professional years. Two years later, Carlos performed at TV Tupi, singing \"Tutti Frutti\" (R. Penniman/J. Lubin/D. La Bostrie). In that period, he was scheduled to open a Bill Haley show at the Maracanazinho (Rio), when he became acquainted with Erasmo Carlos (then Erasmo Esteves). In 1958, Carlos met the \"Matoso gang,\" as were known the future artists Tim Maia, Jorge Ben, and the same Erasmo Esteves, among others, who would meet at Matoso Street at Tijuca (a neighborhood of Rio). Carlos, Erasmo, and Tim Maia (together with Edson Trindade, Arl\u00eanio L\u00edvio, and Jos\u00e9 Roberto \"China\") formed the group the Snacks (later the Sputniks), playing balls and performing on TV (including at Carlos Imperial's Clube do Rock on TV Continental, where Carlos was already a regular). The group was soon dissolved due to the incompatibility between Carlos and Maia.\n\nAfter working as an extra in several films such as Ag\u00fcenta o Roj\u00e3o and Minha Sogra \u00e9 da Pol\u00edcia (in which they backed up Cauby Peixoto on one song), Carlos and Erasmo played together in Erasmo's quartet the Snakes until Carlos was called by Imperial to take Carlos Lyra's place in the Os Terr\u00edveis band that played Elvis Presley covers on TV shows and live performances contracted by Imperial. \n\nSoon, Carlos left the band to try to become a bossa nova artist. Strongly influenced by Jo\u00e3o Gilberto in that period, Carlos often tried to \"sit-in\" at the famous temples Plaza nightclub and the clubs of the Beco das Garrafas, but to no avail. A testimony of his ephemeral and unaccomplished bossa nova phase is Carlos' first album, with \"Jo\u00e3o e Maria\" and \"Fora do Tom\" (both by Imperial). In August 1960, a new release was launched, again in the bossa vein, \"Brotinho Sem Ju\u00edzo\" and \"Can\u00e7\u00e3o do Amor Nenhum\" (again, both by Imperial). At the same time, Carlos would participate regularly in shows presented by Imperial, Os Brotos Comandam (TV Continental and R\u00e1dio Guanabara) and Festa de Brotos (TV Tupi). In 1961, in the same year in which Carlos recorded his first LP (a derivation toward boleros and ballads, Louco por Voc\u00ea) that earned some acceptance at the time (3,500 copies sold in one year), he accepted the suggestion of the record company CBS and changed his style to youth music, starting to write songs with the composer/lyricist who would become his most important collaborator: Erasmo Carlos. The duo's first hit was Carlos' rendition for an Erasmo version of \"Splish Splash\" (Bobby Darin), having as the B-side another classic written by them, \"Parei na Contram\u00e3o.\" The album was recorded and launched in 1963 as Carlos' fifth 78 rpm, accompanied by Renato e seus Blue Caps. It sold 7,500 copies, a modest amount today, but it represented a considerable selling then and the milestone of a new time. \n\nIn 1964, the LP \u00c9 Proibido Fumar (backed by the Youngsters) had hits with the title track (by Carlos/Erasmo) and with Erasmo's version of \"Road Hog\" (Gwen/John D. Loudermilk), \"O Calhambeque.\" It sold almost 12,000 copies in 18 months and was considered high-selling then, but still behind the leader Carlos Alberto (a bolero singer), who was selling more than twice as much. Nevertheless, Carlos' nationwide success was ascending, with more and more invitations for TV and radio shows and CBS wanting to take him to Argentina. That year, Carlos recorded the same repertory in Spanish, also backed by the Youngsters, and the album Es Prohibido Fumar was released by the end of 1964 in Argentina. It was planned to also be distributed in Brazil, but as the military government considered anything in Spanish (the language of Fidel Castro and Che Guevara) dangerous to the country, the album was simply taken out of the catalog by the recording company. \n\nIn 1965, Carlos was elected the King for the first time by direct vote of the audience in a contest promoted by Ant\u00f4nio Aguillar on his Reino da Juventude show. Later, the title would be confirmed at the highly popular Chacrinha show and it would be his for life. \n\nIn the same year, Roberto Carlos Canta Para a Juventude broke all records established by the singer until then, by far surpassing Carlos Alberto and his Amor Perdido. Carlos' album reached fifth place according to IBOPE (a most-accredited public opinion research institute), however, it quickly fell several positions. In fact, he would only have an album at number one of the top parade by the end of the year, with his next LP. Until then, his rising success would sell over 20,000 copies of the double single with \"Hist\u00f3ria de um Homem Mau\" (reaching fourth place on the charts) and 50,000 copies of his single \"N\u00e3o Quero Ver Voc\u00ea Triste\", \n\nOn September 5, Roberto Carlos opened the legendary show Jovem Guarda as the main host and also featuring Vanderl\u00e9a and Erasmo Carlos by his side. The show gave the name and directives to the first musical scene produced especially for Brazilian youth, representing a major cultural/behavioral/commercial breakthrough. After the show debut, Carlos' popularity reached levels unimagined until then. Scoring hits in Argentina and Brazil, Carlos became the best-seller for CBS. A double single with \"A Garota do Baile,\" Carlos reached number two in November, behind the Beatles' \"Help!\" But his album Jovem Guarda, also launched in November, took only one week to push \"Help!\" out of number one on the Brazilian charts, selling almost 200,000 copies in one year. \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" became a nationwide hit and with the exception of brief periods of time, it reigned absolute at number one on the top parade during the entire first semester of 1966. After performing in Argentina, Uruguay, and Paraguay \u2014 countries in which the Spanish version of \"O Calhambeque\" continued to have success \u2014 Carlos went to Europe in April 1966, singing in Portugal (where \"Calhambeque\" and \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo Pro Inferno\" were in first place on Lisbon charts). Returning to Brazil, he soon departed for a tour that started in South America, then Central and North America, where he sang in Los Angeles, Miami, and New York, then Europe (London, Paris, Berlin, and Lisbon). Roberto Carlos, released in December 1966 and went right to number one in the second week (remaining there until April 1967), sold 300,000 copies in less than a year. Also in 1967, Carlos starred the feature film Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura (whose soundtrack sold 300,000 copies, staying at number one from December 17 until June 1968; the film also broke all box-office records until then); won fifth place at the III FMPB (Festival of Brazilian Popular Music of the TV Record, S\u00e3o Paulo) with \"Maria, Carnaval e Cinzas,\" by Lu\u00eds Carlos Paran\u00e1 (reaching number one as a single in November); participated in the MIDEM Festival in Cannes, France; and won the Chico Viola trophy for the songs \"Quero Que V\u00e1 Tudo pro Inferno\" and \"Esque\u00e7a\" and for the LP Jovem Guarda. In June of the same year, Carlos departed for a series of shows in Europe, Africa, Asia, and the U.S. In Italy, he participated in the Venice Song Festival. \n\nIn 1968, Carlos left Jovem Guarda, which due to his absence would soon cease to exist. His departure was a result of a mature decision to migrate from a youth idol profile to that of a romantic singer. In the same year, Carlos won the San Remo Festival (XVIII Festival della Canzone Italiana) with \"Canzone Per Te\" (Sergio Endrigo) and starred the film O Diamante Cor-de-Rosa (also a box office success), opening his own show Roberto Carlos \u00e0 Noite (TV Record) on March 15. As a romantic singer, Carlos had several hits in the 1970s that still had his creative impetus, such as \"Sua Estupidez,\" \"As Flores do Jardim de Nossa Casa,\" \"Jesus Cristo,\" \"Amada Amante,\" \"Detalhes,\" \"Debaixo dos Carac\u00f3is dos Seus Cabelos,\" \"A Montanha,\" \"A Proposta,\" \"Al\u00e9m do Horizonte,\" \"Olha,\" \"Amante \u00e0 Moda Antiga,\" and \"A Ilha\" (all with Erasmo), along with \"Como Vai Voc\u00ea?\" (Ant\u00f4nio Marcos/M\u00e1rio Marcos), and two songs written by Caetano Veloso especially for him, \"Como Dois e Dois\" and \"Muito Rom\u00e2ntico.\" In that decade, Carlos also consolidated his international career doing regular shows in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America. In the year of 1970, he did his first show at the prestigious Canec\u00e3o, which would be the first of his highly successful annual seasons at the most important Carioca hall in terms of media resonance. In the early '70s, Carlos became the top record-selling Brazilian artist, a position he would keep for many consecutive years. After 1976, his albums were selling over 1,000,000 copies. His 1977 album Roberto Carlos, with \"Falando S\u00e9rio,\" sold 2.2 million copies. His 1978 show also beat all records, with 250,000 spectators in six months throughout Brazil, while the album with \"Caf\u00e9 da Manh\u00e3,\" \"For\u00e7a Estranha,\" and \"Lady Laura\" sold 1.5 million copies.\n\nIn the '80s, Carlos also started to record in English and French (he had already recorded albums in Spanish, Italian, and, naturally, Portuguese), having won the Globo de Cristal trophy, awarded by CBS to Brazilian artists who sell more than five million copies outside Brazil. At the same time, his albums continued to break records in his country. \"Caminhoneiro\" (1984) was aired 3,000 times in a single day, another record soon beaten by his own \"Verde e Amarelo\" (1985), with 3,500 spins. In 1986, he had success at Radio City Music Hall (New York, NY) and, two years later, won the Grammy as the Best Latin American Pop singer. In 1989, his Sonrie reached first place on Billboard's Latin chart. \n\nIn the 1990s, Roberto Carlos became the first Latin American artist to sell more albums than the Beatles (in 1994, having by then sold over 70 million copies of his albums). In the mid-'90s, with the retro Jovem Guarda wave, Carlos, who was worn out among the younger generations who had only known his romantic and sentimental hits directed at a middle-aged audience, had his importance recuperated by young rockers such as C\u00e1ssia Eller, Chico Science & Na\u00e7\u00e3o Zumbi, Bar\u00e3o Vermelho, and Skank, who recorded Rei, a tribute to him with his old Jovem Guarda hits. \n\nIn 1998, his second wife Maria Rita discovered she had cancer (she would die in 1999), which shattered his peace of mind. Trying to keep on with his career, Carlos continued to record and perform after one year of reclusion. In 2001, he broke his contract with Sony (ex-CBS), the recording company through which he had released a vast majority of his albums, due to commercial reasons related to his wife's demise.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Roberto+Carlos\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
