Sangalo is most often recognized by her powerful voice, charisma and live performances. Her music is also very popular in Portugal. She has received 14 nominations for Latin Grammy Awards in her career.\n \nAs a teenager, Sangalo started to sing and play acoustic guitar at events, festivals and presentations of the school where she studied. Her debut show happened in the Ondina Neighborhood, Salvador, in August 1992. With that show she won the Dorival Caymmi trophy, the Grammy of Bahian music. \n\nIn 1993, Sony decided to reform the ax\u00e9 group Banda Eva and she was chosen as the lead singer. With her charismatic image, their first album soon topped the Brazilian album chart. Her live album with the band, Banda Eva Ao Vivo, was their best-selling album, selling over a million copies in 1997. In 1999, she decided to start a solo career and released her first self-titled album. With lots of upbeat Bahian rhythms and ax\u00e9, the album received gold and platinum certification. The following year she released another album, Beat Beleza, which also achieved platinum status.\n\nIn 2001 she released the album Festa. The title teack was very popular and the album got platinum certification. \"Festa\" was her biggest hit single up to that point and the video also received huge airplay. \"Festa\" ended up being the most popular song of 2001 in Brazil. In 2002, she released the compilation album Se Eu N\u00e3o Te Amasse Tanto Assim, titled after one of her biggest number-one hits. The album, which features a duet with American singer Brian McKnight, didn't sell as much , but was still a hit.

It was the lowest-selling solo album of her career but it still managed to receive gold certification.\n\nHer first solo live album MTV Ao Vivo Ivete Sangalo released in 2004, included her biggest hits, lots of them never released on an album before, and some Banda Eva hits. The album received diamond certification and was the second best-selling album of 2004.\n\nHer 2005 album, As Supernovas, received triple platinum certification shortly after it's release. The album was less upbeat than the others and included some songs with a 70's touch, with the big influence of Brazilian singer Ed Motta. She also included the hit \"Soy Loco Por Ti America\", a Gilberto Gil song. \"Quando a Chuva Passar\" recently reached number two on the Brazilian singles chart and was notable for being nominated at the Latin Grammy Awards, an uncommon feature for a non-Spanish speaking singer.\n\nOn December 16, 2006, she performed in the biggest stadium in the world, Maracan\u00e3 in Rio de Janeiro, where Paul McCartney, Rolling Stones, Kiss, The Police, and Madonna have also performed.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Phabullo Rodrigues da Silva, known professionally as Pabllo Vittar, is a Brazilian singer, songwriter and drag queen. Because of her unprecedented success as a drag queen musical artist, Vittar has been credited with influencing public interest in other musical artists who are also drag queens, as well as trans and travestis. She is also known for her activism for the rights of LGBTQ+ people, for which, in 2019, Time magazine included her in its list of Next Generation Leaders. Vittar has been cited by Forbes as \"the most popular drag queen in the world\".\n\nBorn in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds and raised in cities in the interior of Maranh\u00e3o and Par\u00e1, Vittar's taste for music was influenced by her mother and she became interested in the art of drag queens in her teens. Her first professional performances took place in a nightclub in Uberl\u00e2ndia, Minas Gerais, and she gained attention on the internet after the release of the song \"Open Bar\", in October 2015. In December of the same year, her debut EP was released, also titled Open Bar. The following year, she joined the cast of the program Amor & Sexo, on TV Globo, performing musical numbers for two seasons. In 2017, Vittar achieved greater recognition when she released her debut studio album, Vai Passar Mal, which was certified platinum by Pro-M\u00fasica Brazil (PMB) and spawned singles such as \"Todo Dia\", \"K.O.\" and \"Corpo Sensual\". Her second and third studio albums, N\u00e3o Para N\u00e3o (2018) and 111 (2020) were certified platinum by PMB.\n\nReferred to as an \"emblem of gender fluidity\", Vittar makes public appearances with and without her artistic make-up and has expressed her preference for the female pronoun treatment when she is \"in drag\", but has also shown indifference towards the gender-specific pronouns used to address her. Her music is usually a mix of pop with varied genres, including Brazilian musical styles that she grew up listening to, such as tecnomelody, arrocha and forr\u00f3. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pabllo+Vittar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)\u201d, \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d, and \u201cLover\u201d. \n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles \u201ccardigan\u201d and \u201cwillow\u201d topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights. Following Midnights, Taylor Swift announced her eleventh studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d (2024) which was released on April 19, 2024. She announced this record at 66th Annual Grammy Award Show accepting the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for her previous album, Midnights (2022) in honour of receiving her 13th Grammy.\n\nAdditionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.\n\nAlong with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite \u201cAll Too Well\u201d starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures. \n\nFollowing the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour\u2014a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023. The former of which would land Swift as the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand. The latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, her largest album sales in a week span. \u201cIs It Over Now? (Taylor's Version)\u201d, the lead single for 1989 (Taylor's Version), would peak at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nAt the 66th annual GRAMMY Awards, Taylor Swift surprised viewers by announcing her eleventh studio album,  THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. On April 19, 2024, the album was released globally, breaking records: it became the first ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week and sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US. Swift dominated the charts, monopolizing the top 14 spots on the Billboard Hot 100 and securing the top 10 positions on Australia\u2019s ARIA Singles Chart. The lead single, Fortnight, featuring Post Malone, quickly soared to the number-one position on the Hot 100. Additionally, just two hours after the album\u2019s release, Swift surprised fans with a reissue titled THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT: THE ANTHOLOGY, which included 15 extra songs.\n\nSwift has released several songs for film soundtracks. She co-wrote two songs for the Hannah Montana: The Movie soundtrack\u2014 \u201cYou'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\u201d and \u201cCrazier\u201d, and contributed two songs to the Valentine's Day soundtrack, including the single \u201cToday Was a Fairytale\u201d, which was her first number one on the Canadian Hot 100, and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100. She also contributed two original songs to The Hunger Games soundtrack album: \u201cSafe & Sound - from The Hunger Games Soundtrack\u201d, co-written and recorded with The Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett, and \u201cEyes Open\u201d. \u201cSafe & Sound\u201d won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In 2013, Swift recorded \u201cSweeter than Fiction\u201d, a song she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff for the One Chance film soundtrack, which received a Best Original Song nomination at the 71st Golden Globe Awards. Swift and English singer Zayn Malik, mononymously known as Zayn, released a single together, \u201cI Don't Wanna Live Forever\u201d, for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). She also recorded an original song called \u201cBeautiful Ghosts\u201d, which she wrote with Andrew Lloyd Webber for the Cats's soundtrack (2019). In 2020, Swift's documentary Miss Americana featured the song \u201cOnly the Young\u201d which was written after the 2018 United States elections. In 2022, she released an original song titled \u201cCarolina\u201d for Where The Crawdads Sing (2022) inspired by the novel written by Delia Owens. \n\nWith sales of over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is a best-selling music artist. Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, including four Album of the Year wins, which makes Swift the artist with the most awards for that category in history, two Brit Awards (including a Global Icon award), an Emmy Award, 28 [https://guinnessworldrecords.com/]Guinness World Records, 32 American Music Awards (the most wins by an artist), and 23 Billboard Music Awards (the most wins by a woman). She ranked eighth on Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists Chart (2019) and was listed on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015). Swift has been included in various power rankings, such as Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world (2010, 2015 and 2019) and Forbes Celebrity 100 (placing first in 2016 and 2019). She was named Woman of the Decade (2010s) by Billboard, Artist of the Decade (2010s) by the American Music Awards, and Person of the Year (2023) by Time Magazine. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "30 Seconds to Mars is an American alternative rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1998. The band consists of brothers Jared Leto (lead vocals, guitar, bass, keyboards) and Shannon Leto (drums, percussion). During the course of its existence, it has undergone various line-up changes with the Leto brothers being the only consistent members.\n\nThe band's debut album, 30 Seconds to Mars (2002), was produced by Bob Ezrin and released to positive reviews but only to limited commercial success. The band achieved worldwide fame with the release of its second album A Beautiful Lie (2005), which received multiple certifications all over the world. Its next release, This Is War (2009), showed a dramatic evolution in the band's musical style, as it incorporated experimental music as well as eclectic influences. The recording process of the album was marked by a legal dispute with record label EMI that eventually became the subject of the documentary film Artifact (2012). Thirty Seconds to Mars then moved to Universal Music and released the fourth album, Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams (2013), to critical and commercial success. It was followed by America (2018), which polarized critics upon release. Their newest, It's the End of the World but It's a Beautiful Day, released on September 15, 2023.\n\nAs of September 2014, the band had sold over 15 million albums worldwide. Thirty Seconds to Mars has consistently enjoyed sold out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. The band is noted for its energetic live performances and for fusing elements from a wide variety of genres, through its use of philosophical and spiritual lyrics, concept albums, and experimental music. Thirty Seconds to Mars has received several awards and accolades throughout its career, including a Guinness World Record, and has been included in the Kerrang! list of best artists of the 2000s.\n\nBand's Logo\nThe band's phoenix logo.The band's phoenix logo (which the band named \"Mithra\") bears the phrase \"Provehito in Altum\", the band's motto, roughly translated from Latin as \"Launch forth into the deep\", but a more stylized version would be \"Rocket in(to) High(ness)\" or \"March The Skies\". The logo was primarily used for promotion of the band's debut, whereas for A Beautiful Lie, the new Trinity logo was created consisting of three skulls, along with the band's name and motto. For This Is War, the band has adopted the alchemical symbol for air, continuing on the sky/air theme.\n\nThe Echelon\nThe Echelon is a publicity street team for the band 30 Seconds to Mars, which helps in bringing friends to the shows, phoning local radio stations to request the band's songs, putting up posters, posting to band forums or related bulletin boards online, voting for the band in official award nominations and maintaining magazines or websites dedicated to the band. It is also the name of one of their songs in the album 30 Seconds to Mars.\n\nStudio albums:\n30 Seconds to Mars - 2002\n\nTheir debut self-titled album, 30 Seconds to Mars, released on August 27, 2002 in the United States through Immortal and Virgin. Jared Leto described the record as a concept album that focuses on human struggle and self-determination, in which otherworldly elements and conceptual ideas are used to illustrate a truthful personal situation. The album reached #107 on the US Billboard 200 and number one on the US Top Heatseekers, selling 121,000 copies in the United States alone. It was preceded by the single \"Capricorn (A Brand New Name)\", which peaked at number 31 on the US Mainstream Rock chart and entered the top ten of the UK Rock Chart. Upon its release, 30 Seconds to Mars was met with mostly positive reviews; a critic felt that the band has \"managed to carve out a unique niche for themselves in the rock realm.\" Although the album was a slow-burning success, it eventually sold two million copies worldwide as of March 2011.\n\n\nA Beautiful Lie - 2005\nA Beautiful Lie was released on August 30, 2005 in the United States. Because the album was leaked five months before its release, the band decided to include two bonus tracks: \"Battle of One\" (an original song that was also set to be the album's title track when it was first announced) and \"Hunter\" (a cover of the Bj\u00f6rk song).\n\nIt has since been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and has reached platinum and gold status in several countries, with a sales total of over four million. It was led by \"Attack\", which made its radio debut on June 6, 2005 and became the most added track on American modern rock radio during its first week of release. \n\nDuring 2005, Thirty Seconds to Mars released the album's second single, \"The Kill\", which set a record for the longest-running hit in the history of the US Modern Rock chart when it remained on the national chart for more than 50 weeks, following its number three peak in 2006. Its music video, directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym of Bartholomew Cubbins, received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award.\n\n\nThis Is War - 2009\nThis is War released through Virgin Records and EMI on December 8, 2009. Upon its release, it peaked at #18 on the Billboard 200.\n\nLeto described the style as \"much more electronic and experimental, with lots of vintage synths.\" Leto also mentioned that he had written lyrics about some themes he felt were missing from their previous work, such as optimism and sexuality only for the song \"Stranger in a Strange Land\".\n\nThe music video for the song \"Hurricane\" was banned by MTV and several other TV channels around the world. The video, which runs for 13 minutes and 10 seconds and was directed by Jared Leto under the pseudonym Bartholomew Cubbin, premiered on MTV on November 29, 2010. The video was censored and banned because of its elements of violence, nudity and sex. On November 28, 2010, Jared Leto posted the letter from MTV about the censorship of the video on his blog. The list features the offending scenes, such as a woman running her finger on the anus of another G-string woman, which was classified as \"restricted\". It was only this shot which had made the video completely restricted.\n\n\nLove, Lust, Faith and Dreams - 2013\nLove, Lust, Faith and Dreams (stylized as LOVE LUST FAITH + DREAMS) was released through Virgin Records on May 17, 2013. Upon release, peaked #6 on the Billboard 200 and sold 52,000 copies in its first week of release.\n\nLove, Lust, Faith and Dreams is a concept album revolving around the themes after which the album is named. The album is divided into four segments, each named Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams, with the beginning of each segment declared by a female voice proclaiming the name of the segment before the beginning of a song or at the end of an interlude which introduces the next segment of the album.\n\nA more specific album concept can be seen inside the CD. It is recognized by four colors, with the color red standing for Love, yellow for Lust, green for Faith, and blue for Dreams. LOVE contains \"Birth\" and \"Conquistador\". LUST contains \"Up in the Air\", \"City of Angels\", \"The Race\", \"End of All Days\" and \"Pyres of Varanasi\". FAITH contains \"Bright Lights\", \"Do or Die\" and \"Convergence\". DREAMS contains \"Northern Lights\", and \"Depuis Le D\u00e9but\".\n\n\"Up in the Air\" was released as the lead single from Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on March 19, 2013. A CD copy of the single was sent to NASA and SpaceX for launch aboard the Dragon spacecraft on SpaceX CRS-2. The mission was launched atop a Falcon 9 rocket on March 1, 2013, sending the first ever commercial copy of music into space. The spacecraft berthed and docked with the International Space Station on March 3, 2013, making the single available to play by the Expedition 35 crew aboard the station. The song made its worldwide debut aboard the station on March 18, 2013 and was released as a Digital download single on iTunes the next day. The music video was released on April 19, 2013 worldwide on Vevo.\n\n\"City of Angels\" was sent to US Modern rock radio as a promotional single from Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on July 23, 2013. A music video for \"City of Angels\", featuring Bartholomew Cubbins as director, was released onto YouTube on October 29, 2013. It was shot over two days on August 18 and 19, 2013, in Los Angeles, California.\n\n\"Do or Die\" was released as a promotional single from Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams on September 9, 2013 in Europe. During the Summer European Tour, Jared confirmed the band was recording footage for a live video for the song. The music video was released on August 5, 2013 worldwide on Vevo. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/30+Seconds+to+Mars\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She is the daughter of Brazilian country singer Zez\u00e9 Di Camargo from the duo Zez\u00e9 Di Camargo & Luciano.\n\nShe was also the spokesperson for various different brands, such as Maybelline, and several products based on her image targeting young girls (dolls, shoes, make-up) were released.\n\nCurrently, besides being a singer, Wanessa is also the ambassadress in the non-governamental organization SOS Mata Atl\u00e2ntica, which defends the preservation of the Atlantic Forest. Due to her hard work in promoting the NGO and its goals, and also working for the depollution of the Tiet\u00ea river, in S\u00e3o Paulo, Wanessa was awarded in 2007 with the Pro-Social Award from Brazil's Nickelodeon channel, and later received the Personality of the Year title from the Cisesp.\n\nWanessa was the first Brazilian female singer to have her first two singles reach #1 in Brazil. She has also performed a duet on television with Italian singer Eros Ramazzotti during one of his promotional trips to Brazil, and her newest album Total features a duet with another Italian singer, Gigi D'Alessio, in the song Um Cora\u00e7\u00e3o Apaixonado (Un Cuore Malato), also included in D'Alessio's Made In Italy Brazilian album edition.\n\nAfter marrying the businessman Marcus Buaiz on May 26th., Wanessa kept working on her new album with Nashville producer Jason Deere and Miami producer Cesar Lemos.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, known professionally as Lady Gaga, (born March 28, 1986 in New York, NY) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. She is known for her image reinventions and musical versatility. Gaga began performing as a teenager, singing at open mic nights and acting in school plays. She studied at Collaborative Arts Project 21, through the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, before dropping out to pursue a career in music. After Def Jam Recordings canceled her contract, she worked as a songwriter for Sony/ATV Music Publishing, where she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and KonLive Distribution, in 2007. Gaga had her breakthrough the following year with her debut studio album, The Fame, and its chart-topping singles \"Just Dance\" and \"Poker Face\". The album was later reissued to include the EP The Fame Monster (2009), which yielded the successful singles \"Bad Romance\", \"Telephone\" and \"Alejandro\".\n\nGaga's five succeeding studio albums all debuted atop the US Billboard 200. Her second full-length album, Born This Way (2011), explored electronic rock and techno-pop and sold more than one million copies in its first week. The title track became the fastest-selling song on the iTunes Store, with over one million downloads in less than a week. Following her EDM-influenced third album, Artpop (2013), and its lead single \"Applause\", Gaga released the jazz album Cheek to Cheek (2014) with Tony Bennett, and the soft rock album Joanne (2016). She ventured into acting, winning awards for her leading roles in the miniseries American Horror Story: Hotel (2015\u20132016) and the musical film A Star Is Born (2018). Her contributions to the latter's soundtrack, which spawned the chart-topping single \"Shallow\", made her the first woman to win an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, Golden Globe Award and Grammy Award in one year. Gaga returned to dance-pop with her sixth studio album, Chromatica (2020), which yielded the number-one single \"Rain on Me\". She followed this with her second collaborative album with Bennett, Love for Sale, and a starring role in the biopic House of Gucci, both in 2021.\n\nHaving sold an estimated 170 million records, Gaga is one of the world's best-selling music artists and the only female artist to achieve four singles that each sold at least 10 million copies globally. Her accolades include 13 Grammy Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, 18 MTV Video Music Awards, awards from the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Council of Fashion Designers of America, and recognition as Billboard's Artist of the Year (2010) and Woman of the Year (2015). She has also been included in several Forbes' power rankings and ranked fourth on VH1's Greatest Women in Music (2012). Time magazine named her one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2010 and 2019 and placed her on their All-Time 100 Fashion Icons list. Her philanthropy and activism focus on mental health awareness and LGBTQ+ rights; she has her own non-profit organization, the Born This Way Foundation, which supports the wellness of young people. Gaga's business ventures include Haus Labs, a vegan cosmetics brand launched in 2019. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was written by Max Martin, Savan Kotecha, Rickard G\u00f6ransson and Minaj, and produced by Martin, G\u00f6ransson and Ilya, with Kuk Harrell serving as a vocal producer. The song was first sent to hot adult contemporary radio on 28 July 2014 through Republic Records and released as a digital download the next day by Lava and Republic Records as the lead single from Jessie J's third studio album Sweet Talker (2014). It is also included on the deluxe version of Grande's second studio album My Everything (2014), serving as the third single from that album.\n\n\"Bang Bang\" debuted at number six and later peaked at number three on the US Billboard Hot 100.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Combining the genre-hopping sounds of Gwen Stefani, and the feisty attitude of P!nk, songwriter Jessie J overcame various career setbacks and health problems to become a star in her own right. Born Jessica Cornish in Chadwell Heath, London in 1988, she started her career in show biz at the age of 11, performing in the West End production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Whistle Down the Wind. After studying musical theater at the prestigious BRITS School, she signed a deal with indie label Gut Records, which went bankrupt before releasing any of her music.\n\nFollowing a minor stroke at age 18, she gained a Sony publishing contract and penned hits for the likes of Chris Brown, Dutch X Factor winner Lisa Lois, and Miley Cyrus (the American number two hit \"Party in the USA\"). After building up an established online presence, she signed to Universal Records and began working with the likes of hitmaker Dr. Luke (Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson), Atlanta rapper B.o.B, and R&B producer Labrinth on her debut album, Who You Are. In 2010, her first single, \"Do It Like a Dude,\" originally written for Rihanna, reached number 25 in the U.K. charts and, following in the footsteps of Adele, Florence + the Machine, and Ellie Goulding, she was announced as the winner of the Critics Choice Award at the 2011 Brits. That same year, an appearance on Saturday Night Live coincided with her album being reissued in the U.S.\n\nFollowing a tour that took in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, Malaysia, and her first show in North America, Jessie J became the first U.K. female solo artist to achieve six Top Ten singles from a single studio album. The success of the sixth single, \"LaserLight,\" featuring David Guetta, was aided in no small part by her appearance as judge on the U.K. edition of The Voice. The hit show gave the singer a chance to display her talent for musical coaching, while building a rapport with fans both old and new on prime-time television. Also involved were Tom Jones and will.i.am, with whom Jessie J performed at Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Concert in June 2012, before heading back to the studio to work on the follow-up to Who You Are.\n\nAfter finishing her second and final season of coaching on The Voice in 2013, J returned with the singles \"Wild\" and \"It's My Party,\" which preceded her second album, Alive, that September. With a planned U.S.-only version of Alive featuring collaborations with Pharrell Williams eventually put aside, J instead focused on recording new material for what would become her third studio album, Sweet Talker. Including the likes of Diplo, the-Dream, and the aforementioned Pharrell, the album also saw her join forces with De La Soul and 2 Chainz, while Ariana Grande and Nicki Minaj both featured on the lead single, \"Bang Bang,\" which debuted at number one in the U.K. and became a Top Ten hit in the U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and Bulgaria. Sweet Talker arrived in October 2014, reaching the Top Ten in the U.S. and U.K. Taking a break from music, she joined the cast of judges on television singing competition The Voice Australia. She returned in 2017 with the singles \"Real Deal\" and \"Queen,\" which later appeared on her fourth LP, R.O.S.E. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Jessie+J\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Best known as Rita Lee, was a Brazilian MPB singer, composer, multi-instrumentalist, actress, writer, TV host and animals rights activist of American and Italian descent, being regarded as the \"Queen of Brazilian Rock\".\n\nRita helped to incorporate the rock revolution into the creative explosion of tropicalismo, formed the most celebrated Brazilian rock band in the world, Os Mutantes, and created solo songs with enormous popular appeal without losing her freedom and irreverence.\n\nFormer member of the group Os Mutantes (1966 \u2014 1972) and leader of the band Tutti Frutti (1973 \u2014 1978), Lee participated in important revolutions in the world of music and society, such as the Tropic\u00e1lia movement during the Brazilian dictatorship, which led her to be the artist with the most censored songs in Brazil during that period. Her songs, usually watered with an acid irony or with a claim for female independence and sexual topics, became ubiquitous in the charts. The album, Fruto Proibido (1975), released together with the band Tutti Frutti, is commonly seen as a fundamental milestone in the history of Brazilian rock, considered by some as her masterpiece.\n\nIn 1976, Lee began a romantic relationship with guitarist Roberto de Carvalho and since then he has been the partner on most of her songs and accompanied her in all her live performances. They had three children, including Beto Lee, also a guitarist, who accompanies his parents in concerts. With a career that has reached 50 years, Rita Lee has gone from the musical innovation of the late 1960s and 1970s to the highly successful romantic ballads of the 1980s. In October 2008, Rolling Stone magazine promoted the List of the 100 Greatest Artists in Brazilian Music, where Rita Lee ranks 15th.\n\nIn 2001, Rita Lee won the Latin Grammy for Best Portuguese Language Rock Album with \"3001\". She would receive five more nominations for the award and in 2022, she was awarded the Musical Excellence award for her body of work. In 2012, she announced that she would retire from performing live due to physical frailty. \"I retire from shows, but never from music,\" she wrote on Twitter. \n\nShe was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2021 and had been undergoing treatment for the disease. She passed away in her hometown of S\u00e3o Paulo at the age of 75 on May 8, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rita+Lee\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Created between July and August of 2005 in the city of \"Aracaju/SE\", FINITUDE has been growing, since then, through a long and hard path in search of musical and artistic growth, more specifically, but not restricted to, in the form of expression known as \"Heavy Metal\".\n\nThe starting point of this journey was the recording of the first CD-demo, titled \"Way of Wisdom\", during the period of January to April of 2006. A production conceived completely independently and unexpectedly considering the short time of formation. However, this work helped to set the term \"band\" and the interest of remaining as a group and making good music.\n\nThus, was created FINITUDE 's first release, composed by five copyrighted tracks, a great graphic production and a striking concept involving assertions of psychology and strictly human doubts. Adding up, furthermore, striking \"riffs\" and catchy tunes setting an excellent result, attested by the many positive reviews from specialized media, as well as an excellent reception from the public.\n\nThe first official show of the band combined the launch of the CD \"Way of Wisdom\" and the strong presence of the public, on April 22, 2006, paving the way to follow, then, with several presentations in support of this work throughout the respective year.\n\nIn addition, during late 2006 and early 2007, the band returned to the studio and recorded a single unique to the Internet, entitled \"Inside a Human's Head\". This track had a positive impact and quickly became a constant song at every show. However, because of conflicts of interest, then keyboardist James Freitas left the band during the production of this \"Web-single\".\n\nIn February 2007, FINITUDE was invited to participate in the \"Projeto Ver\u00e3o\", a large event sponsored by the city of \"Aracaju/SE\", which was attended by national and regional artists. Even with a lot of adversity the band made an excellent performance, pleasing to the large audience.\n\nDuring the same year, FINITUDE was invited to share the stage in a series of concerts in the Northeast with the gaucho band BURNING IN HELL. For this to happen, the band recruited the work of guitarist Icarus Reis, whose premiere took place at a concert in the city of \"Lagarto/SE\" that preceded the tour; his effectiveness as an official member quickly concretized itself.\n\nThis tour was extended to major cities in the northeast, including \"Paulo Afonso (BA)\", \"Aracaju (SE)\", \"Macei\u00f3 (AL)\", \"Recife (PE)\", \"Natal (RN)\" and \"Fortaleza (CE)\", with great shows where the public welcomed quite warmly the music made by FINITUDE.\n\nUndoubtedly, 2007 was a year of a lot of recognition for the band, since several were the contacts, appearances and interviews in specialized magazines, websites and newspapers. Several positive and optimistic reviews left on the CD-Demo \"Way of Wisdom\", in particular from the magazines: Rock Brigade, Roadie Crew, Rock Hard Valhalla and Commando Rock; Apart from the sites: Whiplash, Novo Metal, Metal Attack, All The Bangers, MetalVox, etc.\n\nEnding 2007 with a balance more than positive, the band even opened the show of the renowned band Hangar, from the renowned drummer Aquiles Priester, at the show house \"ATPN\", \"Aracaju/SE\".\n\nIn 2008, the band started on the right foot being selected, among many others throughout Brazil, to be part of the biggest independent rock event in full carnival, the \"PALCO DO ROCK\" in the city of Salvador/BA. A great show for an audience estimated in the thousands and excellent organization.\n\nIn the same year the band released another promotional single, \"Never See My Fall\". Certainly a unique work that has come up with a different theme from the previous, but not less important. This CD-single was well received and contains three new songs that cover a phenomenological view of the world in relation to man. Furthermore, it brings a sound ranging from a quick metal, a refined ballad and a fully orchestral range, bringing the band more critical and positive reviews.\n\nIn order to create an excellent and complete material for the fans, the single also included an interactive track (CD-ROM) containing photos, text, song lyrics and a documentary video called \"Making of (A film by Finitude)\", which shows much of the production process of the single, interviews and live performances of the band. This video and many others can be checked in FINITUDE channel on Youtube.\n\nAnother great moment of 2008 was the opening of Andr\u00e9 Matos' show, former lead singer of the renowned band VIPER, ANGRA, SHAMAN and SYMFONIA, then in solo career, in the period of August of that year. He shared the stage with FINITUDE to perform the track \"Pride\" of the album \"Ritual\" (2002) from his former band SHAMAN (Video also available on the You Tube channel of the band).\n\nFINITUDE has also been indicated in the second half of 2008 as a band revelation by the Dynamite Music Prize, the largest celebration of the independent scene in Brazil.\n\nIn January 2009 the band opened a show for Blaze Bayley, former lead singer of IRON MAIDEN. A great show that came to leave a marc in the history of FINITUDE with the opening to one of the great names in \"heavy metal history\" (Video also available on the website You Tube band). Immediately thereafter, the band made an excellent performance in the \"Rua da Cultura\", opening the annual season of concerts of this recognized cultural space in Sergipe. In February, the band participated again in the \"Projeto Ver\u00e3o\", sharing the stage with the irreverent singer Arnaldo Antunes.\n\nStamping the great job that FINITUDE has been executing in the recent years, the specialist website \"All The Bangers\" chose the CD \"Never See My Fall\" as the best CD-single of 2008 by its technical team. Another immeasurable recognition.\n\nIn June, drummer Andr\u00e9 Moreira left the band without personal and agreement issues, to follow his own path. For his post, the band recruited Arnaldo Silva, quite prepared drummer and recognized in the Sergipe music scene.\n\nThe band then stopped activities for a short period, returning to rehearsals and shows in early 2010, invited almost immediately to join the \"Virada Cultural\", another great event sponsored by the city of Aracaju/Sergipe, again with great impact on the local scene.\n\nHowever a great career move was necessary, especially after these years of experience and interest to climb another step, so, FINITUDE focused entirely on the composition and production of the first official album, spending most of the year of 2010 concentrated in this complex, but important, process to create new songs.\n\nThe production of the album was very cautious, with production and arrangements on behalf of the band itself, accepting up of logo - as the first big decision - register it with professional studios and hometown of the band. The musical direction was in charge of Luiz Gustavo, taking care of the whole registration step and editing new compositions. In the course of 2010 and early 2011, it was recorded all instruments and performances, with some participation of local musicians recording voices (female and choirs) and playing unusual instruments to the genre adopted by the band, as percussions.\n\nDuring the period from 2011 to 2013 occurred: the mixing sessions led by Alex Souza, prominent Sergipe producer in the \"underground\" scene; photo sessions for the booklet and dissemination; preparation of artwork in charge of Djalma Moreira, with Ezra Baptist Jesus' illustrations - also local artist - and all launching negotiation process of the CD. Altogether the album has eleven (11) tracks, with ten (10) original and a rewrite, with new guise, of the title track \"Dissensio Homines\", original of the first CD-demo of FINITUDE.\n\nThe CD \"Dissensio Homines Pt. I\" is a concept album, extending the concept started in the demo-CD \"Way of Wisdom\" (2006) and was officially launched in the second half of 2013 by Ms Metal Records, the label that FINITUDE closed for give wide visibility to \"play\" in the domestic market, in addition to \"press\" services (Ms Metal Press), keeping the band's name in all specialized media outlets.\n\nIn 2014 the band found themselves in the middle of the album dissemination process, starting the year with an excellent release show in the \"Republica\" show house on February the first with participation of bands Headd - independent - and Tchandala - also part of the \"cast\" of MS Metal Records -, aiming to strengthen the music scene of Sergipe, Northeast, and in greater extent, Brazil.\n\nWith the excellent reception of the album \"Dissensio Homines Pt. I\" by the public and specialized media, FINITUDE was once again nominated for the Dynamite Music Award 2014 in the category of best heavy metal album. The indication marking a great work that the band has been performing.\n\n2014 was also the year of release of the first official clip of the band, as part of his album release plan. The chosen track was \"Another Direction\", the last track of the \"play\". The clip was produced by the experienced director Marcel Magalh\u00e3es, accompanied by his excellent staff: Arthur Pinto (Cinematography) and Pritty Reis (Art Direction). The video was made available on the official website of Finitude on Youtube: (http://youtu.be/i4wZzf5mrLg) and since it's release it has a big hit in the social media, expecially Facebook.\n\n2015 is a celebratory year, the band celebrates 10 years on the road and lots of music. The work should never stop, but renew, so FINITUDE is rehearsing it's new show, renewing the official site (www.finitude.com.br) and already taking the first steps to a second album.\n\nFor this celebratory year, three (3) videos (web clips) have already been released for the tracks \"Choices and Wills\" (https://youtu.be/fvPA0zh6jJw), \"Days and Nights\" (https://youtu.be/e6M2OE23BSE) e \"Finitude\" (https://youtu.be/6QtHXAA6SLU), all three available on the Official Youtube Channel (http://youtube.com/finitudeonline).\n\nThis year will also be marked by the departure of \"\u00cdcaro Reis\", leaving the band to pursue a career in other projects and distinct sounds of heavy metal, so FINITUDE will remain a quartet, with many plans and the same love for music, without ever closing doors.\n\nThe important thing is that excellent news are on it's way, stay tuned. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Finitude\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is the fourth track on her ninth studio album \"evermore\", which was released on December 11, 2020, by Republic Records. It was written and produced by Swift and Aaron Dessner.\n\nIn the liner notes of the album, Swift wrote that one of the song storylines on evermore was about \u201cwhat happens when [Dorothea] comes back [from Hollywood] for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame.\u201d This likely refers to \u201c\u2018tis the damn season\u201d given the lyrical mentions of both Los Angeles and the winter holidays. Notably, \"evermore\" was released two weeks prior to Christmas 2020, making the title timely yet ironic.\n\nSwift also teased the title in an Instagram story two days before she announced the album.\n\nProducer and co-writer Aaron Dessner told Rolling Stone:\n\n\"That song, to me, has always felt nostalgic or like some sort of longing. And the song that Taylor wrote is so instantly relatable, you know, \u2018There\u2019s an ache in you put there by the ache in me.\u2019 I remember when she sang that to me in my kitchen \u2014 she had written it overnight during The Long Pond Studio Sessions, actually.\"\n\nThis song debuted #39 on Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, being the fourth-highest charting song off the album. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/_/%E2%80%98tis+the+damn+season\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "lastfm_content_artist": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989 in West Reading, PA) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwriting, which is often inspired by her personal life, has received widespread media coverage and critical praise.\n\n\n\nSwift rose to mainstream prominence with her sophomore studio album, Fearless (2008), a country pop record with crossover appeal. Aided by the top-five singles \u201cLove Story\u201d and \u201cYou Belong with Me\u201d, Fearless was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Swift's third studio album, Speak Now (2010), blended country pop with elements of rock and featured the top-ten singles \u201cMine\u201d and \u201cBack to December\u201d. \n\nDrawing inspiration from various pop, rock, and electronic genres, Swift's fourth studio album Red (2012) saw her transcending her country roots. She completely moved to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), and expanded the electropop sound on her next two studio albums, reputation (2017) and Lover (2019), which respectively embraced urban and retro styles. The four albums spawned a string of international top-five singles, including \u201cWe Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\u201d, \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d, \u201cShake It Off\u201d, \u201cBlank Space\u201d, \u201cBad Blood\u201d, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d, \u201cME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! at the Disco)\u201d, \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d, and \u201cLover\u201d. \n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift experimented with folk and alternative rock on her eighth and ninth studio albums, folklore and evermore (both 2020), whose lead singles \u201ccardigan\u201d and \u201cwillow\u201d topped charts around the world. She also released the critically acclaimed documentaries Miss Americana and Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions that year. Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights (2022), marked her triumphant return to pop after two folk albums. The album set the record for biggest first day and first week ever on Spotify, spawned the hits Anti-Hero and Lavender Haze, and sold over 1.5 million copies in its first week becoming not only the biggest debut of the decade but also Swift's biggest debut ever. She would make history by becoming the first artist to occupy the entire top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 with tracks from Midnights. Following Midnights, Taylor Swift announced her eleventh studio album, \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d (2024) which was released on April 19, 2024. She announced this record at 66th Annual Grammy Award Show accepting the award for Best Pop Vocal Album for her previous album, Midnights (2022) in honour of receiving her 13th Grammy.\n\nAdditionally, Swift began re-recording her back catalog in November 2020 as a result of a publicized dispute with talent manager Scooter Braun and her former label Big Machine, regarding the acquisition of the masters of her back catalog. In April 2021, Swift released a re-recorded issue of her 2008 album Fearless, titled Fearless (Taylor's Version). It debuted at number one in the US. Swift continued releasing re-recorded versions of her back catalog in November, 2021 with the release of Red (Taylor's Version), a 30 track re-issue of her 2012 critical smash. The album debuted at #1 in the US, spawned the #1 hit All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From the Vault), and broke the record at the time for biggest first day for a female album on Spotify. Red (Taylor's Version) was a critical and commercial hit, and proved that Swift's ambitious, yet ongoing plan to re-record her first 6 albums was well worth it.\n\nAlong with the release of Red (Taylor's Version) came All Too Well: The Short Film (2021), Swift's filmmaking debut. The 15 minute romantic drama was based on the lyrical content from Swift's 2012 fan favorite \u201cAll Too Well\u201d starring Sadie Sink and Dylan O'Brien. It had a limited theatrical release in major cities, and Swift held special screenings of the film throughout 2022 at various film festivals. In December, 2022 Taylor announced that she would be making her feature directorial debut with Oscar-winning studio Searchlight Pictures. \n\nFollowing the release of Midnights, Swift would embark on her first tour in five years, The Eras Tour\u2014a retrospective tour covering the entirety of her discography. During her ongoing tour, Swift would release her next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) in July and 1989 (Taylor's Version) in October of 2023.
